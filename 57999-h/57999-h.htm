<h2>
PREFACE</h2>

<p>The place of the tragedies of Seneca in literature is unique. They
stand as the sole surviving representatives, barring a few fragments,
of an extensive Roman product in the tragic drama. They therefore serve
as the only connecting link between ancient and modern tragedy. They
are, moreover, modeled more or less closely after the tragedies of
Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; and the Greek and Roman product
in literature along parallel lines cannot be better studied than by
a comparison of these Senecan plays with their Greek prototypes&mdash;a
comparison which is not possible in comedy, since, unfortunately, the
Greek originals of Plautus and Terence have not come down to us.</p>

<p>These plays are of great value and interest in themselves, first, as independent
dramatic literature of no small merit; and second, as an illustration
of the literary characteristics of the age of Nero: the florid, rhetorical style,
the long, didactic speeches, the tendency to philosophize, the frequent
epigram, the pride of mythologic lore.</p>

<p>Popular interest in the tragedies of Seneca has been growing to a considerable
extent during the last generation. This has been stimulated
in part by Leo's excellent text edition, and by the researches of German
and English scholars into Senecan questions, more especially into the
influence of Seneca upon the pre-Elizabethan drama; in part also by the
fact that courses in the tragedies have been regaining their place, long
lost, in college curricula.</p>

<p>The present edition seeks still further to bring Seneca back to the
notice of classical scholars, and at the same time to present to the English
reader all of the values accruing from a study of these plays, with the single
exception of the benefit to be derived from a reading of the original.
The influence which the tragedies have had in English literature is brought
out in the introduction, which Professor Manly has kindly contributed;
the relation of Seneca to the Greek dramatists is shown by comparative
analyses of the corresponding plays, so arranged that the reader may easily
observe their resemblances and differences; the wealth of mythological
material is at once displayed and made available by an index of mythological
characters; finally, it is hoped that the translation itself will prove to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>be as faithful a reproduction of the original as is possible in a translation,
and at the same time to have sufficient literary merit of its own to claim
the interest of the general reader.</p>

<p>The text used is that of Leo (Weidmann, Berlin, 1878), except in the
instances noted. The line numbers as printed in the translation are identical
with those of the original text. The meter employed in the spoken
parts is the English blank verse, with the exception of the <i>Medea</i>, in which
the experiment was tried, not altogether successfully, of reproducing the
iambic trimeter of the original. In the lyric parts, the original meters are
sometimes used; and, where these did not seem suitable in English, appropriate
substitutes have been attempted.</p>

THE INFLUENCE OF THE TRAGEDIES OF SENECA UPON
EARLY ENGLISH DRAMA</h3>

<p>To appreciate fully the nature and the extent of the influence of Seneca
upon English tragedy in the days of Shakespeare and his immediate predecessors,
we must bear in mind that the public theaters were not the only
places at which plays were then produced. At the universities, at the
inns of court (which may be roughly described as combinations of a law
school and a very exclusive social club), and at the Court itself plays were
an important feature of almost every festival. Even those of us who know
these facts are very likely to fail to realize the full meaning of them. We
are likely to regard the non-professional performances as having no more
significance for the history of the drama than amateur performances at
the present day by dramatic clubs and college societies. We are apt to
forget that, in the spacious days of great Elizabeth, learning, especially
classical learning, had a value, an importance, a dignity, which not even
the most academic of us now feels it to have. Our generation, busied
above all things with making a living or with accumulating wealth, regards
the scholar as, with the poet and the artist, the most unpractical and useless
of men at best, tolerated as an ornamental creature whom society can
afford to keep if it does not have to pay him more than it pays a butler or a
chauffeur. To the men of the Renaissance, scholarship and the scholar
had a unique and inestimable value. Ordinary business, in their view,
enabled man to provide a living; religion taught him how to save his soul;
scholarship, the knowledge of the literature and life of the Greeks and the
Romans, enabled him to distinguish his life as a man from that of a beast,
to approach as nearly as possible to that ideal type toward which they
strove, the <i>uomo universale</i>, the perfect gentleman, complete master of
his body, of his mind, of his passions. To men of these views and this
temper, literature&mdash;first, classical literature and then the vernacular literature
produced under the stimulus of it&mdash;was of supreme importance,
and the drama was perhaps the most important form of literature. The
value of literature for those who were then trying to transform the world,
to rebuild it and themselves nearer to the heart's desire, was of course best
recognized by the finest spirits of the age, men like Erasmus, Thomas
More, Walter Raleigh, Edmund Spenser, Philip Sidney. But it seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>have been felt, though in cruder ways, even by the vulgar. An amusing
illustration of this is the little record kept by old Simon Forman, a noted
mountebank and quack doctor, in 1610 and 1611. It has preserved for us
our earliest notices of performances of <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>, and <i>A Winter's
Tale</i>; but this is accidental. The doctor's intention was merely to note
for his own guidance such lessons as he learned from the plays presented on
the stage. Such benefits were, according to the views of wiser men, to
be gained chiefly from comedies; tragedy, and classical tragedy in particular,
had a finer, a more permanent value. Tragedy was the voice of
the wisest men of the world, the ancients, upon the most serious themes of
human life; it not only, as Aristotle had said, purified the mind through
pity and terror, it fortified the inner life, and both by example and by
sententious maxim prepared man to meet the most subtle attacks of fate,
the temptations of success, or the discouragements of failure. Tragedy
therefore had a unique value for the Elizabethans, and the performances
of classical plays, or those written in imitation of the classics, by the universities
or the inns of court, did not fall into the abyss which now receives
amateur theatricals.</p>

<p>Failure to take account of the value attached to the lessons and the
examples of tragedy may perhaps account for the misunderstanding
which exists so widely, even among scholars, in regard to the first tragedy
in English, <i>Gorboduc, or Ferrex and Porrex</i>. Everyone knows that this
was written in direct imitation of Seneca, and everyone discusses glibly
its Senecan features, the bloody theme, the division into five acts, the use
of the chorus, the removal of the action from the view of the spectators,
the long speeches; but critics are, without exception, offended to the heart
by the fifth act, and especially by the two long disquisitions of Arostus and
Eubulus. It is, however, no exaggeration to say that the play exists solely
for the sake of these speeches. This was not a mere academic exercise. It
was a serious attempt by some of the most thoughtful men of England to
move the queen, Elizabeth, to a course of action which they regarded as
absolutely essential to the welfare of the realm. Other attempts to secure
the same end were made by her best statesmen throughout the reign. The
failure of this effort was not due to the weakness of the tragedy, but, like
the failure of all the rest, to some feature of Elizabeth's character or
some circumstance in her life which has not yet been fully and convincingly
explained. The purpose of the writers is clear. They wished to persuade
Elizabeth to marry and settle once for all the succession to the throne of
England. They, in common with all thoughtful and patriotic Englishmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>feared the horrors of an unsettled succession or a divided rule. These
they tried to impress upon her mind and heart by examples drawn from
the history of Gorboduc and his sons, and by maxims and exhortations
presented in the most authoritative form known to them, the form of
Senecan tragedy. The occasion chosen was a great festival given by the
gentlemen of the Inner Temple, one of the most important and influential
of the inns of court referred to above.</p>

<p>Classical tragedy had, then, as we can readily see, a prestige to which
hardly anything in literature corresponds at the present day. The statesman
who should today wish to influence his sovereign to an important
course of action would doubtless be puzzled to find any form of literature&mdash;academic
or unacademic&mdash;appropriate to the task in dignity and authority.</p>

<p>It is not strange, therefore, that classical tragedy, the tragedy of the
schools and the learned societies, must be taken seriously into account in
estimating the forces which shaped the drama of the popular stage. It is
true that the English tragedies in classical or Senecan form were none of
them written for the public stage. It is even probable that they would
not have been successful upon it. It is a mistake to treat them historically
and critically, as if they belonged to the direct line of development which
resulted in <i>Faustus</i> and <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>Lear</i> and
<i>Othello</i>. But none the less the influence of these academic plays was very
real and very important.</p>

<p>The ways in which this influence was exercised may be noted, as having
some bearing upon the nature and extent of the influence. In the first
place, there was in the early days no very rigid line between the academic
and the popular performers. The Children of the Chapel Royal were at
one time the leading theatrical company in London. When the queen
visited Oxford in 1566, there were among the several plays presented by
the university, not only the Latin tragedy, <i>Progne</i>, of Dr. James Calfhill,
but also the English <i>Palamon and Arcite</i> of Richard Edwards, Master of Her
Majesty's Children and the most popular dramatist of his day. Edwards
himself trained the students who produced his play, and it was a great
success; according to a contemporary report, "certain courtiers said that
it far surpassed <i>Damon and Pythias</i>, than which they thought nothing could
be better; likewise some said that if the author did any more before his
death, he would run mad." Any impressions made upon Edwards by
Dr. Calfhill's <i>Progne</i> were doubtless lost to art, as Edwards died before the
end of the year; but this was probably not the first occasion on which the
Master of the Chapel Children had visited the university in behalf of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>drama, and Edwards himself had been both a scholar and a probationary
fellow there. Certainly his famous <i>Damon and Pythias</i> shows some
evidences of the influence of Seneca.</p>

<p>It is well known also that the most successful writers for the public
stage in the years just preceding Shakespeare's advent, the years that
determined the forms and the methods of the popular drama, were educated
at the universities, and, however clearly they may have recognized the
necessity of supplying to the populace story, action, the raw material of
life and philosophy, cherished as an ideal the Senecan interest in situation,
the Senecan love for broad description, for introspection and reflection,
for elaborate monologue, and catchy sententiousness. Such were Greene
and Peele and Marlowe; and Thomas Kyd, author of that most popular
of plays, <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, and probable author of the version of
<i>Hamlet</i> which held the stage for fourteen years before Shakespeare revised
it and gave it a new and a different life, though not bred in either university,
was more zealous about his Latin and apparently more influenced by
Seneca than the university men themselves.</p>

<p>But, says some modern classical scholar, granting that these early
dramatists were university men or men, like Kyd and Shakespeare, not
trained in the universities but all the more zealous to match their productions
with those which bore the official mark of classical scholarship, why
should Seneca, a second-rate Roman tragedian, be continually cited in
connection with classical influence instead of Aeschylus and Sophocles and
Euripides, the supreme masters of ancient tragedy, and Aristotle, the
unique expositor of the theory of the drama? The men of the Renaissance
would have had a ready answer. In the first place, they knew very little
about the Greek tragedians, or, for that matter, about Greek literature
in general; for although the rediscovery of Greek literature was undoubtedly
one of the events of that remarkable spurt of the human intellect and
spirit which we call the Renaissance, Greek literature and life were, after
all, in every country of Europe, far less important than Latin, as models for
imitation, as sources of inspiration, as objects which engaged the attention
of the moderns and set the pace which they tried to follow. As for tragedy,
a few scholars in Italy and France and Germany and England knew
Sophocles and Euripides&mdash;Aeschylus was almost unknown&mdash;but the theory
and the practice of tragedy among the classicists were based almost exclusively
upon the example of Seneca and the precepts of Horace. Aristotle
is, indeed, often cited as the ultimate authority, but, although the voice
may be the voice of Aristotle, the opinions are usually those of Scaliger or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>Minturno or Robortelli or Castelvetro, opinions which reduced to inviolable
laws what Aristotle had merely stated as observed practices, and which
supplemented these rules by others drawn from the plays of Seneca, who
was, according to these critics, the most majestic, the most tragic, the most
perfect of the ancient tragedians. That Seneca's majesty seems to critics
of today bombast, that his triumph in tragic quality consists in an accumulation
of horrors and a consistently unfortunate ending, that his perfection
of form is no more than a formal schematism, clear because it is simple and
lifeless&mdash;all this may be true but is beside the mark. To the best spirits
of the Renaissance, whether critical or creative, the ten tragedies which
bore the name of Seneca presented the ideal of tragic art toward which
modern writers should strive if they would be perfect.</p>

<p>What, then, was the influence of Seneca in England? Two excellent
studies of different phases of it have been published, both, unfortunately,
less known than they should be.</p>

<p>The purely formal influence, the influence upon dramatic technique
and upon composition in the large sense of the term, is the subject of Rudolf
Fischer's <i>Die Kunstentwicklung der englischen Tragödie</i>, perhaps the most
ingenious and adequate scheme ever devised for the analysis of the technical
and compositional features of any form of art. Fischer sees in the history
of English tragedy before Shakespeare a steady approximation to the Senecan
type. His argument is open to several objections. In the first place,
he treats as if they belonged to the same simple line of development plays
written for the public stage and the popular taste and those written for
special audiences dominated by scholastic ideals. In the second place, as
Professor Luick has pointed out, he has disregarded the influence exercised
by the original form of the story dramatized upon the dramatic presentation
of it. And, furthermore, he, in common with other students of the subject,
has proceeded upon the assumption that only tragedy could have had any
influence upon tragedy. He has neglected that remark of Ben Jonson's,
which phrases the view not of his own time only but of all ages, "The parts
of a comedy are the same with a tragedy," and has failed to see that for
the structure of English tragedy, Roman comedy and the serious imitations
of it by the men of the Renaissance&mdash;such as Gnapheus' <i>Acolastus</i>, Macropedius'
<i>Asotus</i> and <i>Rebelles</i>, and their anonymous English offspring,
<i>The Nice Wanton</i>&mdash;are no less important than the example of Seneca
himself. But his book is interesting and enlightening as few books on any
subject are.</p>

<p>Entirely different problems are dealt with in J.W. Cunliffe's little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>volume on <i>The Influence of Seneca on Elizabethan Tragedy</i>, a book which,
to the regret of many scholars, has long been out of print, and which
the author ought to reprint with such additions as his continued study of
the subject may suggest. Mr. Cunliffe is mainly concerned with showing
why Seneca appealed to the Elizabethans and with pointing out certain
details of theme, of situation, of theatrical effects, and of expression, which
the popular playwrights owed to Seneca.</p>

<p>To Seneca and the false Aristotle created by the humanists from the
<i>Poetics</i>, the precepts of Horace, the definitions and maxims which sifted
down through the encyclopaedists of the Middle Ages, and the example
of Seneca, not only the men of the Renaissance but even we of today owe
some of our most cherished ideas concerning tragedy. First of all, perhaps,
is the belief that tragedy must end unhappily. The Greeks&mdash;whether
creators or critics&mdash;had no such theory. It was enough for Sophocles and
Aristotle that tragedy should be serious in theme and dignified in characters
and in language. In the second place, we ordinarily believe that a tragedy
should have five acts, and many of us can draw a diagram to prove it.
Shakespeare and his fellows seem to have been dominated by the same
theory, difficult as they sometimes found it to observe. The sacred unities,
dominant so long in Italian and French tragedy, though never observed
in any English play more notable than Addison's <i>Cato</i>, we have learned to
disregard and even to decry, though such an attitude in the Elizabethan
age awakened the censure of Philip Sidney and doubtless required some
hardihood or even recklessness. The chorus also we have long since
abandoned, but Greene and Peele and Kyd and Marlowe and Shakespeare
and others of their time used it more than once and with good effect. They
even, in some instances, combined with it the ghosts and infernal spirits,
which beyond a doubt they owed to Seneca, and made this unearthly chorus,
not only the commentator, but in some sense the subtle director of the action.
Perhaps the most refined form of this is to be seen in the Ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>,
who, though he does not appear technically as Chorus, yet recalls by his
original incitement of the action and his later intervention to renew and
direct it, as well as by his language and his attitude, the ghosts of Tantalus,
Thyestes, Laius, and Agrippina in Seneca, and the spirits of Andrea and
Revenge in <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>. It is perhaps not going too far to find
in the dream-setting of Hauptmann's <i>Elga</i> some reminiscence of Shakespeare's
<i>Taming of the Shrew</i> and Greene's <i>James IV</i>, and consequently,
in a remote sense, of Seneca's introductory figures, Tantalus, Thyestes, and
the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>But these matters and the striking resemblances in situation and in
utterance cited so abundantly by Cunliffe and by Munroe (<i>Journal of
Philology</i>, Vol. VI, pp. 70-79), though they could be increased by many passages
in <i>Macbeth</i> and <i>King Lear</i> as well as in the plays of other dramatists
than Shakespeare, are after all not fundamental. Some other features
that seem fundamental may be noted.</p>

<p>In the first place, although it is doubtless true that the scanty scenery
of the Elizabethan stage is largely the excuse and the reason for the long
descriptive passages with which the dramatists of that time delighted
themselves and delight us, their modern readers, this is perhaps not the
whole of the story. There are passages of exposition, of reflection, of pure
declamation, equally long as well as equally beautiful. The Renaissance
love of talk, of fine language, of <i>eloquentia</i>, may explain this in part; but
it is doubtless due in part also to the example of Seneca, who never loses an
opportunity for a long passage of description or introspection or reflection
or mere declamation&mdash;making them indeed for the Chorus when the situation
does not allow them to the ordinary <i>dramatis personae</i>.</p>

<p>Then we may note that the thoroughly melodramatic character of
Elizabethan tragedy is a natural inheritance from Seneca. Greek tragedy
had, to be sure, many melodramatic situations, along with others of a
milder type. But the religious element in the tragedy of Aeschylus and
Sophocles radically modifies the character and tone of the most poignant
and repulsive themes and situations. When Seneca took the most difficult
of Greek themes and, following the lead of Euripides, cast away the over-ruling,
compulsive dominance of the Greek theocracy, he produced melodrama.
Most moderns have been either content to follow him or compelled
to do so for lack of the ability to create striking situations without the aid
of villains of melodramatic criminality. A few of the French tragedians
have had recourse to the method of the Greeks either by reviving the Greek
mythology and theocracy or by resorting to Hebrew history for characters
whose deeds, however criminal, were necessary parts of a divine plan.
Shakespeare, almost alone, has at his best succeeded in substituting for the
gods and fate the inevitable results of human character and the moral law,
in presenting the worst deeds of his leading figures as less the results of
free intention than of futile efforts to deliver themselves from the web of
circumstance which their first crimes or follies have woven about them&mdash;the
whole career of Macbeth, for example, being the necessary outcome of
his attempt to get free of the difficulties and dangers brought upon him by
the murder of Duncan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>Speculation as to what the English drama might have been if Sophocles
instead of Seneca had been its inspiration and its model is idle. The men
of the Renaissance did not understand Sophocles; his stage, the mode of
production of his plays, his aim, the whole nature of his art, were beyond
the scholarship of their day. And it is doubtful whether they could in any
event have made so successful a combination of the Greek and the national
or mediaeval drama as they made of Senecan tragedy and the dramatic
forms they already possessed.</p>

<p>In one thing, at any rate, the English drama was especially fortunate,
that is, in the fact that its form and its content were so largely determined
by two such remarkable men as Marlowe and Shakespeare. The conditions
in France in the sixteenth century were strikingly similar to those in
England, except for the number of public theaters. M. Petit de Julleville
points out that France as well as England possessed every item of the motley
list of dramatic types enumerated by Polonius; and he continues: "Rien
n'empêchait alors qu'un Shakespeare naquit en France; les circonstances
n'étaient-elles pas merveilleusement favorables? Mais, en dépit de certaines
théories, les grands hommes ne paraissent pas tout juste au moment
où ils sont nécessaires. Il nous fallait un Shakespeare; il naquit un
Alexandre Hardy!"

<div class="i2">Oh, who in all this realm is glad? O fate,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Creon</i>: Afar from Thebes there is a frowning grove<span class="linenum">530</span></div>
<div class="i2">Near the well-watered vale of Dirce's fount.</div>
<div class="i2">And there a cypress lifts its giant head</div>
<div class="i2">And holds within its evergreen embrace</div>
<div class="i2">The trees around. Here stands an ancient oak</div>
<div class="i2">And spreads its branches dark with clustering mould.</div>
<div class="i2">One side is torn by time's destructive hand;<span class="linenum">535</span></div>
<div class="i2">The rest, with roots decayed and falling, hangs</div>
<div class="i2">Supported on a neighbor's trunk. Here stand</div>
<div class="i2">The bitter laurel, rustling linden trees,</div>
<div class="i2">The myrtle, and the alder destined soon</div>
<div class="i2">To sweep its oarage on the boundless sea.</div>
<div class="i2">Midway, a mighty pine its smooth trunk lifts<span class="linenum">540</span></div>
<div class="i2">Against the rays of Phoebus and the winds,</div>
<div class="i2">And with its heavy shade it overwhelms</div>
<div class="i2">The lesser trees; for, with its spreading boughs,</div>
<div class="i2">It stands, the giant guardian of the wood.</div>
<div class="i2">Beneath this pine there springs a gloomy pool<span class="linenum">545</span></div>
<div class="i2">That never saw the sun nor light of day.</div>
<div class="i2">An oozy swamp surrounds the sluggish pool.</div>
<div class="i2">Here did the agéd priest direct his steps;</div>
<div class="i2">Nor was there need to wait; the gloomy spot</div>
<div class="i2">Supplied the shades of night. A trench is dug,</div>
<div class="i2">Where brands are kindled, pluck'd from funeral pyres.<span class="linenum">550</span></div>
<div class="i2">The priest is shrouded in a mourning pall,</div>
<div class="i2">And waves the bough; his dark robe sweeps the earth.</div>
<div class="i2">And now, in squalid garb and wrapped in gloom,</div>
<div class="i2">The priest advances, with his hoary locks<span class="linenum">555</span></div>
<div class="i2">Encircled by the yew-tree's deadly leaves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></div>
<div class="i2">Black sheep and sable oxen, backward driven,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></div>
<div class="i2">Are sacrificed. The fire devours the food,</div>
<div class="i2">And the living entrails quiver in the flames.</div>
<div class="i2">The shades he calls, and him who rules the shades,</div>
<div class="i2">And him who guards the dark Lethaean stream.<span class="linenum">560</span></div>
<div class="i2">A magic rune he mutters o'er and o'er</div>
<div class="i2">And fiercely chants the charm which either lures</div>
<div class="i2">The shifting ghosts, or forces them to come.</div>
<div class="i2">He burns the victims whole, and fills the trench</div>
<div class="i2">With sacrificial blood, and snowy milk,<span class="linenum">565</span></div>
<div class="i2">And, with his left hand pouring, mingles wine;</div>
<div class="i2">Again he chants, and, bending to the earth,</div>
<div class="i2">With stronger words and frantic, summons up</div>
<div class="i2">The manes. Loudly bayed the hounds of hell;</div>
<div class="i2">And thrice the hollows gave a mournful sound;<span class="linenum">570</span></div>
<div class="i2">The whole earth trembled and the solid ground</div>
<div class="i2">Was rent asunder. Then the priest exclaimed:</div>
<div class="i2">"I have prevailed, for strong the words I spoke;</div>
<div class="i2">The deep and gloomy realm of chaos yawns,</div>
<div class="i2">And for the dwellers in the home of Dis</div>
<div class="i2">A way is opened to the world of light."</div>
<div class="i2">The whole wood shrank away; its leaves erect</div>
<div class="i2">In horror stood, the mighty trunks were split,
<span class="linenum">575</span></div>
<div class="i2">And all the grove was smitten with amaze.</div>
<div class="i2">The frightened earth crouched back with hollow groans,</div>
<div class="i2">As if unwillingly she saw the deeps</div>
<div class="i2">Of Acheron assailed; or else herself,</div>
<div class="i2">That back to life the dead might find a way,</div>
<div class="i2">With crashing sound her close-wrought barriers burst;<span class="linenum">580</span></div>
<div class="i2">Or threefold Cerberus in angry rage</div>
<div class="i2">Clanked loud his heavy chains. Then suddenly</div>
<div class="i2">The earth yawned wide, and at our very feet</div>
<div class="i2">A deep abyss appeared. I saw, myself,</div>
<div class="i2">The sluggish pools amidst the dusky shades;</div>
<div class="i2">I saw the shadowy gods, and that black gloom</div>
<div class="i2">No earthly night can give. At that dread sight</div>
<div class="i2">My blood ran cold and froze within my veins.<span class="linenum">585</span></div>
<div class="i2">And then there hurried forth a dreadful band,</div>
<div class="i2">And stood in armed array, that viper brood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></div>
<div class="i2">The troop of brothers sprung from dragon's teeth;</div>
<div class="i2">And that fell pestilence, the curse of Thebes.</div>
<div class="i2">Then grim Erinys raised her piercing cry,</div>
<div class="i2">Blind Fury, Dread, and all the ghastly forms<span class="linenum">590</span></div>
<div class="i2">Which spawn and lurk within the endless shades:</div>
<div class="i2">Grief, in her madness, tearing out her hair;</div>
<div class="i2">Disease, scarce holding up her weary head;</div>
<div class="i2">Age, burdened with itself, and brooding Fear.</div>
<div class="i2">Our spirits died within us at the sight.<span class="linenum">595</span></div>
<div class="i2">Even the prophet's daughter stood amazed,</div>
<div class="i2">Though well she knew her father's mystic arts.</div>
<div class="i2">But he, undaunted, since he saw them not,</div>
<div class="i2">Convoked the bloodless throng of gloomy Dis.</div>
<div class="i2">Like clouds the shadowy forms come trooping up,</div>
<div class="i2">And snuff the air of unrestricted heaven.</div>
<div class="i2">Not lofty Eryx in his mountain glades<span class="linenum">600</span></div>
<div class="i2">As many falling leaves, nor Hybla's slopes</div>
<div class="i2">As many flowers produce, in sunny spring,</div>
<div class="i2">When greedy bees in teeming bunches swarm;</div>
<div class="i2">As many waves break not upon the shore;</div>
<div class="i2">As many birds deserting Strymon's streams,</div>
<div class="i2">Exchange not wintry blasts and Arctic snows,<span class="linenum">605</span></div>
<div class="i2">And seek the milder valley of the Nile;</div>
<div class="i2">As were the shades the prophet summoned forth.</div>
<div class="i2">In eager haste the shivering spirits seek</div>
<div class="i2">The hiding-places of the leafy grove.</div>
<div class="i2">From out the cave, his right hand by the horns<span class="linenum">610</span></div>
<div class="i2">A raging bull restraining, Zethus came,</div>
<div class="i2">And next Amphion, with that famous shell</div>
<div class="i2">Whose magic strains insensate rocks allured.</div>
<div class="i2">Here haughty Niobe, in safety now,</div>
<div class="i2">Amongst her children lifts her head in scorn</div>
<div class="i2">And proudly counts her shades. And worse than she,<span class="linenum">615</span></div>
<div class="i2">That mother, mad Agave, next appears,</div>
<div class="i2">With all the impious band who rent the king.</div>
<div class="i2">Then Pentheus' self, all torn and bleeding, comes,</div>
<div class="i2">In rage pursuing those wild Bacchanals.</div>
<div class="i2">At length, when often summoned, Laius comes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></div>
<div class="i2">In shame, and, skulking, flees the shadowy throng,<span class="linenum">620</span></div>
<div class="i2">And hides himself away; but still the seer,</div>
<div class="i2">With unrelenting purpose pressing on,</div>
<div class="i2">Repeats his strong compelling exorcisms,</div>
<div class="i2">Until he brings the ghost to open view.</div>
<div class="i2">I shudder as I tell it. There he stood,</div>
<div class="i2">A fearful sight, his body drenched with blood,</div>
<div class="i2">His matted locks o'erspread with horrid filth.<span class="linenum">625</span></div>
<div class="i2">And now, with raging tongue, the specter spoke:</div>
<div class="i2">"O wild and savage house of Cadmus, thou</div>
<div class="i2">Who ever dost rejoice in brother's blood!</div>
<div class="i2">The thyrsus wave, in madness rend thy sons.</div>
<div class="i2">The greatest crime of Thebes is mother's love.</div>
<div class="i2">O fatherland, 'tis not the wrath of heaven,<span class="linenum">630</span></div>
<div class="i2">But sin of man by which thou art undone.</div>
<div class="i2">No plague-fraught south wind with its deadly blast,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor yet the parchéd earth with its dry breath,</div>
<div class="i2">Is harming thee; but 'tis thy bloody king,</div>
<div class="i2">Who, as the prize of savage murder done,</div>
<div class="i2">Hath seized his father's scepter and his bed.<span class="linenum">635</span></div>
<div class="i2">An impious son (but far more impious,</div>
<div class="i2">The mother who in most unhallowed womb</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The time</span> of the play is confined to the single day of the culmination
of the tragedy, the day proposed by Creon for the banishment of Medea
and marriage of Jason to Creüsa, daughter of Creon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The scene</span> is in Corinth, in the court of the house of Jason.</p>

<p class="p6"><i>Although the play is confined in time to the final day of catastrophe
at Corinth, the background is the whole romantic story of the Argonauts:
how Jason and his hero-comrades, at the instigation of Pelias, the usurping
king of Thessalian Iolchos, undertook the first voyage in quest of the golden
fleece; how, after many adventures, these first sailors reached the kingdom
of Aeëtes who jealously guarded the fleece, since upon its possession depended
his own kingship; how the three deadly labors were imposed upon Jason
before the fleece could be won&mdash;the yoking of the fiery bulls, the contest with the
giants that sprang from the sown serpent's teeth, and the overcoming of the
sleepless dragon that ever guarded the fleece; how, smitten by love of him,
the beautiful, barbaric Medea, daughter of the king, by the help of her magic
aided Jason in all these labors and accompanied him in his flight; how, to
retard her father's pursuit she slew her brother and scattered his mangled
remains in the path as they fled; how again, for love of Jason, she restored
his father to youth and tricked Pelias' own daughters into slaying their agéd
sire; how, for this act, Medea with her husband were exiled from Thessalia
and dwelt in Corinth; how, for ten happy years, she lived with her husband
and two sons in this alien land, her wild past almost forgotten, her magic
untouched.</i></p>

<p><i>But now, Jason has been gradually won away from his wife, and is
about to wed Creüsa, the daughter of Creon, king of Corinth. The wedding
festivities have already begun when the play opens and reveals Medea invoking
all the powers of heaven and hell in punishment of her false lord.</i></p>

<div class="i2">The song! and even now I cannot comprehend</div>
<div class="i2">The vast extent of woe that hath befallen me.</div>
<div class="i2">Could Jason prove so false? Bereft of native land,</div>

<div class="i2">With crime o'ercome for his dear sake? And does he think</div>
<div class="i2">That thus the fatal chapter can be ended? Wild,</div>
<div class="i2">Devoid of reason, sick of soul, my swift mind darts</div>
<div class="i2">In all directions seeking whence revenge may come!</div>

<div class="i2">O impious one, what streams of blood have flowed to work</div>
<div class="i2">Thy ends! And yet, not one of all my crimes by wrath</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Nurse</i> [<i>alone</i>]: My spirit trembles, for I feel the near approach<span class="linenum">670</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of some unseen disaster. Swiftly grows her grief,</div>
<div class="i2">Its own fires kindling; and again her passion's force</div>
<div class="i2">Hath leaped to life. I oft have seen her, with the fit</div>

<div class="i2">And force the very heavens to her will. But now,</div>
<div class="i2">A monstrous deed, of greater moment far than these,<span class="linenum">675</span></div>
<div class="i2">Medea is preparing. For, but now, did she</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
<div class="i2">With step of frenzy hurry off until she reached</div>
<div class="i2">Her stricken home. There, in her chamber, all her stores</div>
<div class="i2">Of magic wonders are revealed; once more she views</div>
<div class="i2">The things herself hath held in fear these many years,</div>
<div class="i2">Unloosing one by one her ministers of ill,</div>
<div class="i2">Occult, unspeakable, and wrapt in mystery;</div>
<div class="i2">And, grasping with her hand the sacred altar-horn,<span class="linenum">680</span></div>
<div class="i2">With prayers, she straightly summons all destructive powers,</div>
<div class="i2">The creatures bred in Libya's sands, and on the peaks</div>
<div class="i2">Of frigid Taurus, clad in everlasting snows.</div>
<div class="i2">Obedient to her potent charms, the scaly brood<span class="linenum">685</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of serpents leave their darksome lairs and swarm to her;</div>
<div class="i2">One savage creature rolls his monstrous length along,</div>
<div class="i2">And darts his forkéd tongue with its envenomed sting,</div>
<div class="i2">Death-dealing; at the charming sound he stops amazed,</div>
<div class="i2">And fold on fold his body writhes in nerveless coils.<span class="linenum">690</span></div>
<div class="i2">"But these are petty ills; unworthy of my hand,"</div>
<div class="i2">She cries, "are such weak, earth-born weapons. Potent charms</div>
<div class="i2">Are bred in heaven. Now, now 'tis time to summon powers</div>
<div class="i2">Transcending common magic. Down I'll draw from heaven</div>
<div class="i2">That serpent huge whose body lies athwart the sky<span class="linenum">695</span></div>
<div class="i2">Like some great ocean stream, in whose constricting folds</div>
<div class="i2">The greater and the lesser Bears are held enthralled,</div>
<div class="i2">The greater set as guide for Grecian ships, the less</div>
<div class="i2">For Sidon's mariners! Let Ophiuchus loose</div>
<div class="i2">His hand and pour forth venom from his captive thrall!</div>
<div class="i2">And let the Python huge, that dared to rear its head<span class="linenum">700</span></div>
<div class="i2">Against the heavenly twins, be present at my prayer!</div>
<div class="i2">Let Hydra's writhing heads, which by Alcides' hand</div>
<div class="i2">Were severed, all return to life and give me aid!</div>
<div class="i2">Thou too be near and leave thy ancient Colchian home,</div>
<div class="i2">Thou watchful dragon, to whose eyes the first sleep came</div>
<div class="i2">In answer to my incantations."</div>
<div class="i6">When she thus<span class="linenum">705</span></div>
<div class="i2">Had summoned all the serpent brood, she cast her store</div>
<div class="i2">Of baleful herbs together; all the poisons brewed</div>
<div class="i2">Amid the rocky caves of trackless Eryx; plants</div>
<div class="i2">That flourish on the snowy peaks of Caucasus,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
<div class="i2">Whose crags were spattered with Prometheus' gore; the herbs<span class="linenum">710</span></div>
<div class="i2">Within whose deadly juice the Arab dips his darts,</div>
<div class="i2">And the quiver-bearing Mede and fleeing Parthian;</div>
<div class="i2">Those potent juices, too, which, near the shivering pole,</div>
<div class="i2">The Suabian chieftains gather in Hyrcanian groves.</div>
<div class="i2">The seasons, too, have paid their tribute to her stores:</div>
<div class="i2">Whatever earth produces in the nesting time,</div>
<div class="i2">And when the stiff'ning hand of winter's frost has stripped<span class="linenum">715</span></div>
<div class="i2">The glory from the trees and fettered all the land</div>
<div class="i2">With icy bonds; whatever flow'ring plant conceals</div>
<div class="i2">Destruction in its bloom, or in its twisted roots</div>
<div class="i2">Distils the juice of death, she gathers to her use.</div>
<div class="i2">These pestilential herbs Haemonian Athos gave;<span class="linenum">720</span></div>
<div class="i2">And these on lofty Pindus grew; a bloody knife</div>
<div class="i2">Clipped off these slender leaves on Macedonia's heights;</div>
<div class="i2">Still others grew beside the Tigris, whirling on</div>
<div class="i2">His flood to meet the sea; the Danube nourished some;</div>
<div class="i2">These grew on bright gem-starred Hydaspes' tepid stream;<span class="linenum">725</span></div>
<div class="i2">And these the Baetis bore, which gave the land its name,</div>
<div class="i2">Displacing with its langourous tide, the western sea.</div>
<div class="i2">These felt the knife when early dawn begins to break;</div>
<div class="i2">The fruit of these was cut in midnight's gloomy hour;</div>
<div class="i2">This fatal crop was reaped with sickle magic-edged.<span class="linenum">730</span></div>
<div class="i2">These deadly, potent herbs she takes and sprinkles o'er</div>
<div class="i2">With serpent <span class="err" title="original: vernom">venom</span>, mixing all; and in the broth</div>
<div class="i2">She mingles unclean birds: a wailing screech owl's heart,</div>
<div class="i2">A ghastly vampire's vitals torn from living flesh.</div>
<div class="i2">Her magic poisons all she ranges for her use.<span class="linenum">735</span></div>
<div class="i2">The ravening power of hidden fire is held in these,</div>
<div class="i2">While deep in others lurks the numbing chill of frost.</div>
<div class="i2">Now magic runes she adds more potent far.</div>
<div class="i6">But lo!</div>
<div class="i2">Her voice resounds! and, as with maddened step she comes,</div>
<div class="i2">She chants her charms, while heaven and earth convulsive rock.</div>

<div class="i2">That punishment would be most fitting and deserved.</div>

<div class="i2">The tender mother-instinct quite possesses me.</div>
<div class="i2">And could I shed my helpless children's blood? Not so,</div>

<div class="i6">Their sin&mdash;that Jason is their sire,</div>
<div class="i2">And, deeper guilt, that I have borne them. Let them die;</div>
<div class="i2">They are not mine. Nay, nay! they are my own, my sons,</div>

<div class="i2">'Tis true&mdash;my brother, too, was innocent. O soul,</div>
<div class="i2">Why dost thou hesitate? Why flow these streaming tears,</div>

<div class="i2">And to their lowest sands the briny waters boil;</div>

<div class="i2">A cavern huge within a mountain's hold</div>

<div class="i2">With all his necks the sheltering earth; and last,</div>

<div class="i2">Claims everything, and nothing spares.</div>
<div class="i2">Hate perishes when love commands,</div>
<div class="i2">And ancient feuds yield to his touch.<span class="linenum">355</span></div>
<div class="i2">Why need I more his sway approve,</div>
<div class="i2">When even stepdames yield to love?</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Chorus:</i> Speak, nurse, the news thou bring'st. How fares the queen?</div>
<div class="i2">Do her fierce fires of love know any end?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Nurse:</i> I have no hope that such a malady<span class="linenum">360</span></div>
<div class="i2">Can be relieved; her maddened passion's flames</div>
<div class="i2">Will endless burn. A hidden, silent fire</div>
<div class="i2">Consumes her, and her raging love, though shut</div>
<div class="i2">Within her heart, is by her face betrayed.</div>
<div class="i2">Her eyes dart fire; anon, her sunken gaze</div>
<div class="i2">Avoids the light of day. Her restless soul<span class="linenum">365</span></div>
<div class="i2">Can find no pleasure long in anything.</div>
<div class="i2">Her aimless love allows her limbs no rest.</div>
<div class="i2">Now, as with dying, tottering steps, she goes,</div>
<div class="i2">And scarce can hold her nodding head erect;</div>
<div class="i2">And now lies down to sleep. But, sleepless quite,</div>
<div class="i2">She spends the night in tears. Now does she bid</div>
<div class="i2">Me lift her up, and straight to lay her down;<span class="linenum">370</span></div>
<div class="i2">To loose her locks, and bind them up again.</div>
<div class="i2">In restless mood she constantly demands</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
<div class="i2">Fresh robes. She has no care for food or health.</div>
<div class="i2">With failing strength she walks, with aimless feet.<span class="linenum">375</span></div>
<div class="i2">Her old-time strength is gone; no longer shines</div>
<div class="i2">The ruddy glow of health upon her face.</div>
<div class="i2">Care feeds upon her limbs; her trembling steps</div>
<div class="i2">Betray her weakness, and the tender grace</div>
<div class="i2">Of her once blooming beauty is no more.</div>
<div class="i2">Her eyes, which once with Phoebus' brilliance shone,</div>
<div class="i2">No longer gleam with their ancestral fires.<span class="linenum">380</span></div>
<div class="i2">Her tears flow ever, and her cheeks are wet</div>
<div class="i2">With constant rain; as when, on Taurus' top,</div>
<div class="i2">The snows are melted by a warming shower.</div>
<div class="i2">But look, the palace doors are opening,</div>
<div class="i2">And she, reclining on her couch of gold,<span class="linenum">385</span></div>
<div class="i2">And sick of soul, refuses one by one</div>
<div class="i2">The customary garments of her state.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i2">From leaves of trees collect. Gird high my robes;<span class="linenum">390</span></div>
<div class="i2">I'll wear no necklace, nor shall snowy pearls,</div>
<div class="i2">The gift of Indian seas, weigh down my ears.</div>
<div class="i2">No nard from far Assyria shall scent</div>
<div class="i2">My locks; thus loosely tossing let them fall</div>

<div class="i2">Upon my left I'll wear a quiver girt,</div>
<div class="i2">And in my right hand will I brandish free</div>
<div class="i2">A hunting-spear of Thessaly; for thus</div>
<div class="i2">The mother of Hippolytus was clad.</div>

<div class="i2">From distant Tanaïs or Maeotis' banks,</div>
<div class="i2">Her comely locks down flowing from a knot,</div>

<div class="i2">Though stern of soul, averse to love, and fierce,</div>

<div class="i2">Thy brow so troubled? Truly is my sire</div>
<div class="i2">In safety, Phaedra safe, and their two sons.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Nurse:</i> Thou need'st not fear for them; the kingdom stands<span class="linenum">435</span></div>
<div class="i2">In prosperous estate, and all thy house</div>
<div class="i2">Rejoices in the blessings of the gods.</div>
<div class="i2">But Oh, do thou with greater kindness look</div>
<div class="i2">Upon thy fortune. For my heart is vexed</div>
<div class="i2">And anxious for thy sake; for thou thyself</div>
<div class="i2">With grievous sufferings dost bruise thy soul.</div>
<div class="i2">If fate compels it, one may be forgiven<span class="linenum">440</span></div>
<div class="i2">For wretchedness; but if, of his own will,</div>
<div class="i2">A man prefers to live in misery,</div>
<div class="i2">Brings tortures on himself, then he deserves</div>
<div class="i2">To lose those gifts he knows not how to use.</div>
<div class="i2">Be mindful of thy youth; relax thy mind.</div>
<div class="i2">Lift high the blazing torch on festal nights;</div>
<div class="i2">Let Bacchus free thee from thy weighty cares;<span class="linenum">445</span></div>
<div class="i2">Enjoy this time which speeds so swiftly by.</div>
<div class="i2">Now is the time when love comes easily,</div>
<div class="i2">And smiles on youth. Come, let thy soul rejoice.</div>
<div class="i2">Why dost thou lie upon a lonely couch?</div>
<div class="i2">Dissolve in pleasures that grim mood of thine,</div>
<div class="i2">And snatch the passing joys;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> let loose the reins.<span class="linenum">450</span></div>
<div class="i2">Forbid that these, the best days of thy life,</div>
<div class="i2">Should vanish unenjoyed. Its proper hue</div>
<div class="i2">Has God allotted to each time of life,</div>
<div class="i2">And leads from step to step the age of man.</div>
<div class="i2">So joy becomes the young, a face severe</div>
<div class="i2">The agéd. Why dost thou restrain thyself,</div>
<div class="i2">And strangle at their birth the joys of life?</div>
<div class="i2">That crop rewards the farmer's labor most<span class="linenum">455</span></div>
<div class="i2">Which in the young and tender sprouting-time</div>
<div class="i2">Runs riot in the fields. With lofty top</div>
<div class="i2">That tree will overspread the neighboring grove,</div>
<div class="i2">Which no begrudging hand cuts back or prunes.</div>
<div class="i2">So do our inborn powers a richer fruit</div>
<div class="i2">Of praise and glory bear, if liberty,</div>
<div class="i2">Unchecked and boundless, feed the noble soul.<span class="linenum">460</span></div>
<div class="i2">Thou, harsh, uncouth, and ignorant of life,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
<div class="i2">Dost spend thy youth to joy and love unknown.</div>
<div class="i2">Think'st thou that this is man's allotted task,</div>
<div class="i2">To suffer hardships, curb the rushing steeds,</div>
<div class="i2">And fight like savage beasts in bloody war?<span class="linenum">465</span></div>
<div class="i2">When he beheld the boundless greed of death,</div>
<div class="i2">The mighty father of the world ordained</div>
<div class="i2">A means by which the race might be renewed.</div>
<div class="i2">Suppose the power of Venus over men</div>
<div class="i2">Should cease, who doth supply and still renew<span class="linenum">470</span></div>
<div class="i2">The stream of life, then would this lovely world</div>
<div class="i2">Become a foul, unsightly thing indeed:</div>
<div class="i2">The sea would bear no fish within its waves,</div>
<div class="i2">The woods no beasts of prey, the air no birds;</div>
<div class="i2">But through its empty space the winds alone</div>
<div class="i2">Would rove. How various the forms of death<span class="linenum">475</span></div>
<div class="i2">That seize and feed upon our mortal race:</div>
<div class="i2">The wrecking sea, the sword, and treachery!</div>
<div class="i2">But say that these are lacking: still we fall</div>
<div class="i2">Of our own gravity to gloomy Styx.</div>
<div class="i2">Suppose our youth should choose a mateless life,</div>
<div class="i2">And live in childless state: then all this world</div>
<div class="i2">Of teeming life which thou dost see, would live</div>
<div class="i2">This generation only, and would fall<span class="linenum">480</span></div>
<div class="i2">In ruins on itself. Then spend thy life</div>
<div class="i2">As nature doth direct; frequent the town,</div>
<div class="i2">And live in friendly union with thy kind.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Hippolytus:</i> There is no life so free, so innocent,</div>
<div class="i2">Which better cherishes the ancient rites,</div>
<div class="i2">Than that which spurns the crowded ways of men</div>
<div class="i2">And seeks the silent places of the woods.<span class="linenum">485</span></div>
<div class="i2">His soul no maddening greed of gain inflames</div>
<div class="i2">Who on the lofty levels of the hills</div>
<div class="i2">His blameless pleasures finds. No fickle breath</div>
<div class="i2">Of passing favor frets him here, no sting</div>
<div class="i2">Of base ingratitude, no poisonous hate.</div>
<div class="i2">He fears no kingdom's laws; nor, in the quest<span class="linenum">490</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of power, does he pursue the phantom shapes</div>
<div class="i2">Of fame and wealth. From hope and fear alike</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
<div class="i2">Is he removed. No black and biting spite</div>
<div class="i2">With base, malicious tooth preys on him here.</div>
<div class="i2">He never hears of those base, shameful things</div>
<div class="i2">That spawn amid the city's teeming throngs.</div>
<div class="i2">It is not his with guilty heart to quake</div>
<div class="i2">At every sound; he need not hide his thoughts<span class="linenum">495</span></div>
<div class="i2">With guileful words; in pride of sinful wealth</div>
<div class="i2">He seeks to own no lordly palace propped</div>
<div class="i2">Upon a thousand pillars, with its beams</div>
<div class="i2">In flaunting arrogance incased with gold.</div>
<div class="i2">No streams of blood his pious altars drench;</div>
<div class="i2">No hecatombs of snowy bullocks stand<span class="linenum">500</span></div>
<div class="i2">Foredoomed to death, their foreheads sprinkled o'er</div>
<div class="i2">With sacred meal; but in the spacious fields,</div>
<div class="i2">Beneath the sky, in fearless innocence,</div>
<div class="i2">He wanders lord of all. His only guile,</div>
<div class="i2">To set the cunning snare for beasts of pray;</div>
<div class="i2">And, when o'erspent with labors of the chase,</div>
<div class="i2">He soothes his body in the shining stream</div>
<div class="i2">Of cool Ilissus. Now swift Alpheus' banks<span class="linenum">505</span></div>
<div class="i2">He skirts, and now the lofty forest's deep,</div>
<div class="i2">Dense places treads, where Lerna, clear and cool,</div>
<div class="i2">Pours forth her glimmering streams.</div>
<div class="i2">Here twittering birds make all the woods resound,</div>
<div class="i2">And through the branches of the ancient beech</div>
<div class="i2">The leaves are all a-flutter in the breeze.<span class="linenum">510</span></div>
<div class="i2">How sweet upon some vagrant river's bank,</div>
<div class="i2">Or on the verdant turf, to lie at length,</div>
<div class="i2">And quaff one's fill of deep, delicious sleep,</div>
<div class="i2">Whether in hurrying floods some copious stream</div>
<div class="i2">Pours down its waves, or through the vernal flowers</div>
<div class="i2">Some murmuring brook sings sweetly as it flows.</div>
<div class="i2">The windfall apples of the wood appease<span class="linenum">515</span></div>
<div class="i2">His hunger, while the ripening berries plucked</div>
<div class="i2">From wayside thickets grant an easy meal.</div>
<div class="i2">He gladly shuns the luxuries of kings.</div>
<div class="i2">Let mighty lords from anxious cups of gold</div>
<div class="i2">Their nectar quaff; for him how sweet to catch</div>
<div class="i2">With naked hand the water of the spring!<span class="linenum">520</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
<div class="i2">More certain slumber soothes him, though his couch</div>
<div class="i2">Be hard, if free from care he lay him down.</div>
<div class="i2">With guilty soul he seeks no shameful deeds</div>
<div class="i2">In nooks remote upon some hidden couch,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor timorous hides in labyrinthine cell;</div>
<div class="i2">He courts the open air and light of day,</div>
<div class="i2">And lives before the conscious eye of heaven.<span class="linenum">525</span></div>
<div class="i2">Such was the life, I think, the ancients lived,</div>
<div class="i2">Those primal men who mingled with the gods.</div>
<div class="i2">They were not blinded by the love of gold;</div>
<div class="i2">No sacred stone divided off the fields</div>
<div class="i2">And lotted each his own in judgment there.</div>
<div class="i2">Nor yet did vessels rashly plow the seas;<span class="linenum">530</span></div>
<div class="i2">But each his native waters knew alone.</div>
<div class="i2">Then cities were not girt with massive walls,</div>
<div class="i2">With frequent towers set; no soldier there</div>
<div class="i2">To savage arms his hands applied, nor burst</div>
<div class="i2">The close-barred gates with huge and heavy stones</div>
<div class="i2">From ponderous engines hurled. As yet the earth<span class="linenum">535</span></div>
<div class="i2">Endured no master's rule, nor felt the sway</div>
<div class="i2">Of laboring oxen yoked in common toil;</div>
<div class="i2">But all the fields, self-fruitful, fed mankind,</div>
<div class="i2">Who took and asked no more. The woods gave wealth,</div>
<div class="i2">And shady grottoes natural homes supplied.</div>
<div class="i2">Unholy greed first broke these peaceful bonds,<span class="linenum">540</span></div>
<div class="i2">And headlong wrath, and lust which sets aflame</div>
<div class="i2">The hearts of men. Then came the cruel thirst</div>
<div class="i2">For empire; and the weak became the prey</div>
<div class="i2">Of strong, and might was counted right. At first</div>
<div class="i2">Men fought with naked fists, but soon they turned<span class="linenum">545</span></div>
<div class="i2">Rough clubs and stones to use of arms. Not yet</div>
<div class="i2">Were cornel spears with slender points of iron,</div>
<div class="i2">And long, sharp-pointed swords, and crested helms.</div>
<div class="i2">Such weapons wrath invented. Warlike Mars</div>
<div class="i2">Produced new arts of strife, and forms of death<span class="linenum">550</span></div>
<div class="i2">In countless numbers made. Thence streams of gore</div>
<div class="i2">Stained every land, and reddened every sea.</div>
<div class="i2">Then crime, o'erleaping every bound, ran wild;</div>
<div class="i2">Invaded every home. No hideous deed</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
<div class="i2">Was left undone: but brothers by the hand<span class="linenum">555</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of brothers fell, parents by children's hands,</div>
<div class="i2">Husbands by wives', and impious mothers killed</div>
<div class="i2">Their helpless babes. Stepmothers need no words;</div>
<div class="i2">The very beasts are kind compared with them.</div>
<div class="i2">Of all these evils woman was the cause,</div>
<div class="i2">The leader she. She with her wicked arts</div>
<div class="i2">Besets the minds of men; and all for her<span class="linenum">560</span></div>
<div class="i2">And her vile, lustful ways, unnumbered towns</div>
<div class="i2">Lie low in smoking heaps; whole nations rush</div>

<div class="i0"><i>Messenger:</i> When, fleeing forth, he left the city's walls,<span class="linenum">1000</span></div>
<div class="i2">With maddened speed he hurried on his way,</div>
<div class="i2">And quickly yoked his chargers to his car,</div>
<div class="i2">And curbed them to his will with close-drawn reins.</div>
<div class="i2">And then, with much wild speech, and cursing loud</div>
<div class="i2">His native land, oft calling on his sire,<span class="linenum">1005</span></div>
<div class="i2">He fiercely shook the reins above his steeds;</div>
<div class="i2">When suddenly, far out the vast sea roared,</div>
<div class="i2">And heaved itself to heaven. No wind was there</div>
<div class="i2">To stir the sea, no quarter of the sky</div>
<div class="i2">Broke in upon its peace; the rising waves</div>
<div class="i2">Were by their own peculiar tempest raised.<span class="linenum">1010</span></div>
<div class="i2">No blast so great had ever stirred the straits</div>
<div class="i2">Of Sicily, nor had the deep e'er swelled</div>
<div class="i2">With such wild rage before the north wind's breath,</div>
<div class="i2">When high cliffs trembled with the shock of waves,</div>
<div class="i2">And hoary foam smote high Leucate's top.</div>
<div class="i2">The sea then rose into a mighty heap,<span class="linenum">1015</span></div>
<div class="i2">And, big with monstrous birth, was landward borne.</div>
<div class="i2">For no ship's wrecking was this swelling pest</div>
<div class="i2">Intended; landward was its aim. The flood</div>
<div class="i2">Rolled shoreward heavily, something unknown</div>
<div class="i2">Within its laden bosom carrying.</div>
<div class="i2">What land, new born, will lift its head aloft?<span class="linenum">1020</span></div>
<div class="i2">Is some new island of the Cyclades</div>
<div class="i2">Arising? Now the rocky heights are hid,</div>
<div class="i2">Held sacred to the Epidaurian god,</div>
<div class="i2">And those high crags well known for Sciron's crime;</div>
<div class="i2">No longer can be seen that land whose shores</div>
<div class="i2">Are washed by double seas. While in amaze<span class="linenum">1025</span></div>
<div class="i2">We look in fear and wonder, suddenly</div>
<div class="i2">The whole sea bellows, and on every side</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
<div class="i2">The towering cliffs re-echo with the roar;</div>
<div class="i2">While all their tops the leaping spray bedews.</div>
<div class="i2">The deep spouts forth and vomits up its waves</div>
<div class="i2">In alternating streams, like some huge whale<span class="linenum">1030</span></div>
<div class="i2">Which roves the ocean, spouting up the floods.</div>
<div class="i2">Then did that mound of waters strongly heave</div>
<div class="i2">And break itself, and threw upon the shore</div>
<div class="i2">A thing more terrible than all our fears.</div>
<div class="i2">The sea itself rushed landward, following</div>
<div class="i2">That monstrous thing. I shudder at the thought.</div>
<div class="i2">What form and bearing had the monster huge!<span class="linenum">1035</span></div>
<div class="i2">A bull it was in form, with dark-green neck</div>
<div class="i2">Uplifted high, its lofty front adorned</div>
<div class="i2">With verdant mane. Its ears with shaggy hair</div>
<div class="i2">Were rough; its horns with changing color flashed,</div>
<div class="i2">Such as the lord of some fierce herd would have,</div>
<div class="i2">Both earth and ocean-born. He vomits flames;<span class="linenum">1040</span></div>
<div class="i2">With flames his fierce eyes gleam. His glossy neck</div>
<div class="i2">Great couch-like muscles shows, and as he breathes,</div>
<div class="i2">His spreading nostrils quiver with the blast</div>
<div class="i2">Of his deep panting. Breast and dewlap hang</div>
<div class="i2">All green with clinging moss; and on his sides</div>
<div class="i2">Red lichens cling. His hinder parts appear<span class="linenum">1045</span></div>
<div class="i2">In monstrous shape, and like some scaly fish</div>
<div class="i2">His vast and shapeless members drag along;</div>
<div class="i2">As are those monsters of the distant seas</div>
<div class="i2">Which swallow ships, and spout<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> them forth again.</div>
<div class="i2">The country-side was panic stricken; herds<span class="linenum">1050</span></div>
<div class="i2">In frenzied terror scattered through the fields;</div>
<div class="i2">Nor did the herdsmen think to follow them.</div>
<div class="i2">The wild beasts in the forest pastures fled</div>
<div class="i2">In all directions, and the hunters shook</div>
<div class="i2">With deadly fear. Hippolytus alone</div>
<div class="i2">Was not afraid, but curbed his frantic steeds<span class="linenum">1055</span></div>
<div class="i2">With close-drawn reins, and with his well-known voice</div>
<div class="i2">He cheered them on. The road to Argos<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> runs</div>
<div class="i2">Precipitous along the broken hills,</div>
<div class="i2">On one side bordered by the roaring sea.</div>
<div class="i2">Here does that massive monster whet himself</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
<div class="i2">And kindle hot his wrath; then, when he felt</div>
<div class="i2">His courage strong within his breast, and when</div>
<div class="i2">His power to attempt the strife he had rehearsed,<span class="linenum">1060</span></div>
<div class="i2">He charged Hippolytus with headlong course,</div>
<div class="i2">The ground scarce touching with his bounding feet;</div>
<div class="i2">And, fearful, stopped before the trembling steeds.</div>
<div class="i2">But this thy son, with savage countenance,</div>
<div class="i2">Stood steadfast, threatening, before the foe.</div>
<div class="i2">His features changed not, while he thundered loud:<span class="linenum">1065</span></div>
<div class="i2">"This empty terror cannot daunt my soul,</div>
<div class="i2">For 'twas my father's task to vanquish bulls."</div>
<div class="i2">But straightway, disobedient to the reins,</div>
<div class="i2">The horses hurried off the car. And now,</div>
<div class="i2">The highway leaving, maddened by their fear,</div>
<div class="i2">They plunged along where'er their terror led,<span class="linenum">1070</span></div>
<div class="i2">And took their way among the rocky fields.</div>
<div class="i2">But he, their driver, as some captain strong</div>
<div class="i2">Holds straight his bark upon the boisterous sea,</div>
<div class="i2">Lest she oppose her side against the waves,</div>
<div class="i2">And by his art escapes the yawning floods;</div>
<div class="i2">Not otherwise he guides the whirling car.<span class="linenum">1075</span></div>
<div class="i2">For now with tight-drawn reins he curbs his steeds,</div>
<div class="i2">And now upon their backs he plies the lash.</div>
<div class="i2">But doggedly that monster kept along,</div>
<div class="i2">Now running by their side, now leaping straight</div>
<div class="i2">Upon them as they came, from every hand</div>

<div class="i2">His head rebounding from the smitten rocks.</div>
<div class="i2">The bramble thickets pluck away his hair,<span class="linenum">1095</span></div>
<div class="i2">And that fair face is bruised upon the stones.</div>
<div class="i2">His fatal beauty which had been his bane,</div>

<div class="i2">Are dragged along upon the flying wheels.</div>
<div class="i2">At last, his bleeding trunk upon a charred</div>

<div class="i2">And for a little, by its master held,<span class="linenum">1100</span></div>
<div class="i2">The car stood still. The horses by that wound</div>
<div class="i2">Were held awhile, but soon they break delay&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">And break their master too. While on they rush,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Deianira:</i> Deep hidden, far within this royal pile,<span class="linenum">485</span></div>
<div class="i2">There is a cave that guards my secret well.</div>
<div class="i2">Neither the rising sun can reach the spot</div>
<div class="i2">With its fresh beams; nor can its latest rays,</div>
<div class="i2">When Titan leads the weary day to rest,</div>
<div class="i2">And plunges 'neath the ruddy ocean's waves.</div>
<div class="i2">There lies a charm that can restore to me<span class="linenum">490</span></div>
<div class="i2">The love of Hercules. I'll tell thee all.</div>
<div class="i2">The giver of the charm was Nessus, he</div>
<div class="i2">Whom Nephele to bold Ixion bore,</div>
<div class="i2">Where lofty<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Pindus towers to the skies,</div>
<div class="i2">And high above the clouds cold Othrys stands.</div>
<div class="i2">For when, compelled by dread Alcides' club<span class="linenum">495</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
<div class="i2">To shift with ready ease from form to form</div>
<div class="i2">Of beasts, and, overcome in every form,</div>
<div class="i2">At last bold Acheloüs bowed his head</div>
<div class="i2">With its one horn defiled; then Hercules,</div>
<div class="i2">Exulting in his triumph, claimed his bride</div>
<div class="i2">And bore me off to Argos. Then, it chanced,<span class="linenum">500</span></div>
<div class="i2">Evenus' stream that wanders through the plain,</div>
<div class="i2">Its whirling waters bearing to the sea,</div>
<div class="i2">Was swollen beyond its banks<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> with turbid flood.</div>
<div class="i2">Here Nessus, well accustomed to the stream,</div>
<div class="i2">Required a price for bearing me across;<span class="linenum">505</span></div>
<div class="i2">And on his back, where beast and human join,</div>
<div class="i2">He took me, boldly stemming every wave.</div>
<div class="i2">Now was fierce Nessus well across the stream,</div>
<div class="i2">And still in middle flood Alcides fared,</div>
<div class="i2">Breasting with mighty strides the eager waves;</div>
<div class="i2">When he, beholding Hercules afar,<span class="linenum">510</span></div>
<div class="i2">Cried, "Thou shalt be my wife, my booty thou,</div>
<div class="i2">For Hercules is held within the stream;"</div>
<div class="i2">And clasping me was galloping away.</div>
<div class="i2">But now the waves could not thwart Hercules.</div>
<div class="i2">"O faithless ferryman," he shouted out,</div>
<div class="i2">"Though Ganges and the Ister join their floods,<span class="linenum">515</span></div>
<div class="i2">I shall o'ercome them both and check thy flight."</div>
<div class="i2">His arrow sped before his words were done,</div>
<div class="i2">Transfixing Nessus with a mortal wound,</div>
<div class="i2">And stayed his flight. Then he, with dying eyes</div>
<div class="i2">Seeking the light, within his hand caught up<span class="linenum">520</span></div>
<div class="i2">The flowing<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> gore; and in his hollow hoof,</div>
<div class="i2">Which he with savage hand had wrenched away,</div>
<div class="i2">He poured and handed it to me, and said:</div>
<div class="i2">"This blood, magicians say, contains a charm,</div>

<div class="i2">Let not the light of day shine on the charm,</div>
<div class="i2">But in the thickest darkness let it lie.</div>
<div class="i2">So shall the blood its magic power retain."</div>
<div class="i2">So spake he; o'er his words a silence fell,</div>
<div class="i2">And the sleep of death upon his weary limbs.</div>

<div class="i4">Of Phoebus' rays: headlong he fell</div>
<div class="i4">And to an unknown sea his name</div>
<div class="i4">He gave. So are great fortunes joined<span class="linenum">690</span></div>
<div class="i4">To mighty ills.</div>
<div class="i4">Let others then as fortunate</div>
<div class="i4">And great be hailed; I wish no share</div>
<div class="i4">Of popular renown. My boat</div>
<div class="i4">Is frail and needs must hug the shore.</div>
<div class="i4">And let no strong wind force my bark<span class="linenum">695</span></div>
<div class="i4">Far out to sea; for fortune spares</div>
<div class="i4">Safe-harbored boats, but seeks the ships</div>
<div class="i4">In mid sea proudly sailing on,</div>
<div class="i4">Their topsails in the clouds.</div>

<div class="i4">Like some Bacchante smitten sore</div>
<div class="i4">With madness, comes our princess forth?</div>
<div class="i4">What new reverse of fortune's wheel</div>

<div class="i0"><i>Nurse:</i> But tell us in what way he conquered fire.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Philoctetes:</i> When all his sorrowing friends began to fell</div>
<div class="i2">The trees on Oeta's slopes, beneath one hand</div>
<div class="i2">The beech-tree lost its foliage and lay,</div>
<div class="i2">Its mighty trunk prone on the ground. One hand</div>
<div class="i2">With deadly stroke attacked the towering pine,<span class="linenum">1620</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
<div class="i2">Which lifted to the stars its threatening top,</div>
<div class="i2">And called it from the clouds. In act to fall,</div>
<div class="i2">It shook its rocky crag, and with a crash</div>
<div class="i2">Whelmed all the lesser forest in its fall.</div>
<div class="i2">Within the forest was a certain oak,</div>
<div class="i2">Wide-spreading, vast, like that Chaonian tree</div>
<div class="i2">Of prophecy, whose shade shuts out the sun,</div>
<div class="i2">Embracing all the grove<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> within its arms.<span class="linenum">1625</span></div>
<div class="i2">By many a blow beset, it groans at first</div>
<div class="i2">In threatening wise, and all the wedges breaks;</div>
<div class="i2">The smiting axe bounds back, its edges dulled,</div>
<div class="i2">Too soft for such a task. At length the tree,</div>
<div class="i2">Long wavering, falls with widespread ruin down.</div>
<div class="i2">Straightway the place admits the sun's bright rays;<span class="linenum">1630</span></div>
<div class="i2">The birds, their tree o'erthrown, fly twittering round,</div>
<div class="i2">And seek their vanished homes on wearied wing.</div>
<div class="i2">Now every tree resounds; even the oaks</div>
<div class="i2">Feel in their sacred sides the piercing steel,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor does its ancient sanctity protect<span class="linenum">1635</span></div>
<div class="i2">The grove. The wood into a pile is heaped;</div>
<div class="i2">Its logs alternate rising high aloft,</div>
<div class="i2">Make all too small a pyre for Hercules:</div>
<div class="i2">The pine inflammable, tough-fibered oak,</div>
<div class="i2">The ilex' shorter trunks. But poplar trees,<span class="linenum">1640</span></div>
<div class="i2">Whose foliage adorned Alcides' brow,</div>
<div class="i2">Fill up the space and make the pyre complete.</div>
<div class="i2">But he, like some great lion in the woods</div>
<div class="i2">Of Libya lying, roaring out his pain,</div>
<div class="i2">Is borne along&mdash;but who would e'er believe</div>
<div class="i2">That he was hurrying to his funeral pyre?</div>
<div class="i2">His gaze was fixed upon the stars of heaven,<span class="linenum">1645</span></div>
<div class="i2">Not fires of earth, when to the mount he came</div>
<div class="i2">And with his eyes surveyed the mighty pyre.</div>
<div class="i2">The great beams groaned and broke beneath his weight.</div>
<div class="i2">Now he demands his bow. "Take this," he said,</div>
<div class="i2">"O son of Poeas, take this as the gift</div>
<div class="i2">And pledge of love from Hercules to thee.</div>
<div class="i2">These deadly shafts the poisonous hydra felt;<span class="linenum">1650</span></div>
<div class="i2">With these the vile Stymphalian birds lie low;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
<div class="i2">And every other monster which I slew</div>
<div class="i2">With distant aim. O noble youth, go on</div>
<div class="i2">In victory, for never 'gainst thy foes</div>
<div class="i2">Shalt thou send these in vain. Wouldst wish to bring</div>
<div class="i2">Birds from the very clouds? Down shall they fall,</div>
<div class="i2">And with them come thine arrows sure of prey.<span class="linenum">1655</span></div>
<div class="i2">This bow shall never disappoint thy hand.</div>
<div class="i2">Well has it learned to poise the feathered shaft</div>
<div class="i2">And send it flying in unerring course.</div>
<div class="i2">The shafts themselves as well, loosed from the string,</div>
<div class="i2">Have never failed to find their destined mark.</div>
<div class="i2">But do thou in return, my only prayer,</div>
<div class="i2">Bring now the funeral torch and light the pyre.<span class="linenum">1660</span></div>
<div class="i2">This club," he said, "which never hand but mine</div>
<div class="i2">Has wielded, shall the flames consume with me.</div>
<div class="i2">This weapon, only, shall to Hercules</div>
<div class="i2">Belong. But this, too, thou shouldst have from me</div>
<div class="i2">If thou couldst bear its weight. But let it serve</div>
<div class="i2">To aid its master's pyre." Then he required<span class="linenum">1665</span></div>
<div class="i2">The shaggy spoil of the dire Nemean beast</div>
<div class="i2">To burn with him. The huge skin hid the pyre.</div>
<div class="i2">Now all the gazing crowd begin to groan,</div>
<div class="i2">And tears of woe to fall from every eye.</div>
<div class="i2">His mother bares her breast in eager grief</div>
<div class="i2">And smites her body stripped e'en to the loins<span class="linenum">1670</span></div>
<div class="i2">For unrestrained lament; then all the gods</div>
<div class="i2">And Jupiter himself she supplicates,</div>
<div class="i2">While all the place re-echoes with her shrieks.</div>
<div class="i2">"Thou dost disgrace the death of Hercules,</div>
<div class="i2">O mother, check thy tears," Alcides said;</div>
<div class="i2">"Within thy heart thy woman's grief confine.</div>
<div class="i2">Why shouldst thou make this day a time of joy<span class="linenum">1675</span></div>
<div class="i2">For Juno with thy tears? For she, be sure,</div>
<div class="i2">Rejoices to behold her rival weep.</div>
<div class="i2">Then this unworthy grief, my mother, check.</div>
<div class="i2">It is not meet to abuse the breast that nursed,</div>
<div class="i2">And the womb that bore Alcides." Thus he spake;</div>
<div class="i2">Then with a dreadful cry, as when he led<span class="linenum">1680</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
<div class="i2">The awful dog throughout the towns of Greece,</div>

<p class="p6"><i>Pelops, the son of Tantalus, had banished his sons for the murder of
their half-brother, Crysippus, with a curse upon them, that they and their
posterity might perish by each others' hands. Upon the death of Pelops,
Atreus returned and took possession of his father's throne. Thyestes, also,
claimed the throne, and sought to gain it by the foulest means. For he seduced
his brother's wife, Aërope, and stole by her assistance the magical, gold-fleeced
ram from Atreus' flocks, upon the possession of which the right to rule was
said to rest. For this act he was banished by the king.</i></p>

<p><i>But Atreus has long been meditating a more complete revenge upon his
brother; and now in pretended friendship has recalled him from banishment,
offering him a place beside himself upon the throne, that thus he may have
Thyestes entirely in his power.</i></p>

<div class="i2">With heavy-laden boughs, o'erweighed<span class="linenum">155</span></div>
<div class="i2">By its own fruit, and mockingly</div>
<div class="i2">Sways to his straining lips. Yet he,</div>
<div class="i2">Though with impatient longing filled,</div>
<div class="i2">As often mocked, so often fails</div>
<div class="i2">To grasp the prize; he turns away<span class="linenum">160</span></div>
<div class="i2">His longing gaze, strains close his lips,</div>
<div class="i2">And grimly bars his hunger fast</div>
<div class="i2">Behind his teeth. But still again</div>
<div class="i2">The whole grove lets its riches down,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
<div class="i2">And flaunts them in his face, soft fruits</div>
<div class="i2">On drooping boughs, and whets once more</div>
<div class="i2">His hunger, bidding stretch again<span class="linenum">165</span></div>
<div class="i2">His hands&mdash;but all in vain. For now,</div>
<div class="i2">When it has lured him on to hope,</div>
<div class="i2">And mocked its fill, the boughs recede,</div>
<div class="i2">And the whole ripe harvest of the wood</div>
<div class="i2">Is snatched far out of reach.</div>
<div class="i2">Then comes a raging thirst more fierce</div>
<div class="i2">Than hunger, which inflames his blood,<span class="linenum">170</span></div>
<div class="i2">And with its parching fires burns up</div>
<div class="i2">Its moisture. There the poor wretch stands,</div>
<div class="i2">Striving to quaff the nearby waves;</div>
<div class="i2">But the fleeing waters whirl away,</div>
<div class="i2">And leave but the empty bed to him</div>
<div class="i2">Who seeks to follow. Quick he quaffs</div>
<div class="i2">At that swift stream, but to drink&mdash;the dust.<span class="linenum">175</span></div>

<h4>ACT II</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Atreus</i> [<i>in soliloquy</i>]: O soul, so sluggish, spiritless, and weak,</div>
<div class="i2">And (what in kings I deem the last reproach)</div>
<div class="i2">Still unavenged, after so many crimes,</div>
<div class="i2">Thy brother's treacheries, and every law</div>
<div class="i2">Of nature set at naught, canst vent thy wrath</div>
<div class="i2">In vain and meaningless complaints? By now</div>
<div class="i2">The whole wide world should be astir with arms,<span class="linenum">180</span></div>
<div class="i2">Thy arms, and on both seas thy ships of war</div>
<div class="i2">Should swarm; the fields and town's should be ablaze,</div>
<div class="i2">And gleaming swords should everywhere be seen.</div>
<div class="i2">Beneath our charging squadrons' thundering tread</div>
<div class="i2">Let Greece resound; let this my enemy</div>
<div class="i2">Within no forest's depths a hiding find.<span class="linenum">185</span></div>
<div class="i2">No citadel upon the mountain heights</div>
<div class="i2">Shall shelter him. Let all the citizens,</div>
<div class="i2">Mycenae leaving, sound the trump of war.</div>
<div class="i2">Whoe'er grants refuge to that curséd head,</div>
<div class="i2">Shall die a dreadful death. This noble pile,</div>
<div class="i2">The home of our illustrious Pelops' line,<span class="linenum">190</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
<div class="i2">I would might fall on me, if only thus</div>
<div class="i2">It might destroy my hated brother too.</div>
<div class="i2">But come, my soul, do what no coming age</div>
<div class="i2">Shall e'er approve&mdash;or e'er forget; some deed</div>
<div class="i2">Must be attempted, impious, bloody, dire,</div>
<div class="i2">Such as my brother's self might claim as his.</div>
<div class="i2">No crime's avenged save by a greater crime.<span class="linenum">195</span></div>
<div class="i2">But where the crime that can surpass his deeds?</div>
<div class="i2">Is he yet crushed in spirit? Does he show</div>
<div class="i2">In prosperous circumstances self-control,</div>
<div class="i2">Contentment in defeat? Full well I know</div>
<div class="i2">His tameless spirit; it can ne'er be bent&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">But can be broken. Then, before his force<span class="linenum">200</span></div>
<div class="i2">He strengthens and opposing powers prepares,</div>
<div class="i2">We must the attack begin, lest, while we wait,</div>
<div class="i2">He strike us unprepared. For well I know</div>
<div class="i2">That he must either slay me or be slain</div>
<div class="i2">By me. There lies the crime between us two:</div>
<div class="i2">Who leaps to grasp it first, the crime shall do.</div>

<div class="i2">Rich fleeced and nobly bred, and with the flock</div>
<div class="i2">A ram, their leader, wondrous, magical;</div>

<div class="i2">Of fine-spun gold, with which the new-crowned kings</div>
<div class="i2">Of Pelops' line are wont t' adorn their scepters.</div>
<div class="i2">Who owns the ram is king, for with his fate<span class="linenum">230</span></div>

<div class="i2">Within a mead whose fateful bounds are fenced</div>

<div class="i2">In silence, all unknown to fame.</div>
<div class="i2">So when my days have passed away</div>

<div class="i2">May I, in meek obscurity<span class="linenum">400</span></div>
<div class="i2">And full of years, decline in death.</div>
<div class="i2">But death lies heavily on him</div>
<div class="i2">Who, though to all the world well known,</div>
<div class="i2">Is stranger to himself alone.</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Messenger:</i> There is upon the lofty citadel</div>
<div class="i2">A part of Pelops' house that fronts the south,</div>
<div class="i2">Whose farther side lifts up its massive walls</div>
<div class="i2">To mountain heights; for so the reigning king</div>
<div class="i2">May better sway the town, and hold in check</div>
<div class="i2">The common rabble when it scorns the throne.</div>
<div class="i2">Within this palace is a gleaming hall,<span class="linenum">645</span></div>
<div class="i2">So huge, it may a multitude contain;</div>
<div class="i2">Whose golden architraves are high upborne</div>
<div class="i2">By stately columns of a varied hue.</div>
<div class="i2">Behind this public hall where people throng,</div>
<div class="i2">The palace stretches off in spacious rooms;</div>
<div class="i2">And, deep withdrawn, the royal sanctum lies,<span class="linenum">650</span></div>
<div class="i2">Far from the vulgar gaze. This sacred spot</div>
<div class="i2">An ancient grove within a dale confines,</div>
<div class="i2">Wherein no tree its cheerful shade affords,</div>
<div class="i2">Or by the knife is pruned; but cypress trees</div>
<div class="i2">And yews, and woods of gloomy ilex wave</div>
<div class="i2">Their melancholy boughs. Above them all<span class="linenum">655</span></div>
<div class="i2">A towering oak looks down and spreads abroad,</div>
<div class="i2">O'ershadowing all the grove. Within this place</div>
<div class="i2">The royal sons of Tantalus are wont</div>
<div class="i2">To ask consent of heaven to their rule,</div>
<div class="i2">And here to seek its aid when fortune frowns.</div>
<div class="i2">Here hang their consecrated offerings:</div>
<div class="i2">Sonorous trumpets, broken chariots,</div>
<div class="i2">Those famous spoils of the Myrtoan sea;<span class="linenum">660</span></div>
<div class="i2">Still hang upon the treacherous axle-trees</div>
<div class="i2">The conquered chariot-wheels&mdash;mementoes grim</div>
<div class="i2">Of every crime this sinful race has done.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
<div class="i2">Here also is the Phrygian turban hung</div>
<div class="i2">Of Pelops' self; and here the spoil of foes,</div>
<div class="i2">A rich embroidered robe, the prize of war.</div>
<div class="i2">An oozy stream springs there beneath the shade,<span class="linenum">665</span></div>
<div class="i2">And sluggish creeps along within the swamp,</div>
<div class="i2">Just like the ugly waters of the Styx</div>
<div class="i2">Which bind the oaths of heaven. 'Tis said that here</div>
<div class="i2">At dead of night the hellish gods make moan,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the grove resounds with clanking chains,</div>
<div class="i2">And mournful howl of ghosts. Here may be seen<span class="linenum">670</span></div>
<div class="i2">Whatever, but to hear of, causes fear.</div>
<div class="i2">The spirits of the ancient dead come forth</div>
<div class="i2">From old, decaying tombs, and walk abroad;</div>
<div class="i2">While monsters, greater than the world has known,</div>
<div class="i2">Go leaping round, grotesque and terrible.</div>
<div class="i2">The whole wood gleams with an uncanny light,</div>
<div class="i2">And without sign of fire the palace glows.</div>
<div class="i2">Ofttimes the grove re-echoes with the sound<span class="linenum">675</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of threefold bayings of the dogs of hell,</div>
<div class="i2">And oft do mighty shapes affright the house.</div>
<div class="i2">Nor are these fears allayed by light of day;</div>
<div class="i2">For night reigns ever here, and e'en at noon</div>
<div class="i2">The horror of the underworld abides.</div>
<div class="i2">From this dread spot are sure responses given<span class="linenum">680</span></div>
<div class="i2">To those who seek the oracle; the fates</div>
<div class="i2">With mighty sound from out the grot are told,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the cavern thunders with the god.</div>
<div class="i2">'Twas to this spot that maddened Atreus came,</div>
<div class="i2">His brother's children dragging in his train.</div>
<div class="i2">The sacrificial altars are adorned&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Oh, who can worthily describe the deed?</div>
<div class="i2">Behind their backs the noble captives' hands<span class="linenum">685</span></div>
<div class="i2">Are bound, and purple fillets wreathe their brows.</div>
<div class="i2">All things are ready, incense, sacred wine,</div>
<div class="i2">The sacrificial meal, and fatal knife.</div>
<div class="i2">The last detail is properly observed,</div>
<div class="i2">That this outrageous murder may be done</div>
<div class="i2">In strict observance of the ritual!</div>

<div class="i2">He makes, and chants the sacrificial song</div>
<div class="i2">With wild and boisterous words; before the shrine</div>
<div class="i2">He takes his place; the victims doomed to death</div>
<div class="i2">He sets in order, and prepares the sword.</div>
<div class="i2">He gives the closest heed to all details</div>
<div class="i2">And misses no least portion of the rite.<span class="linenum">695</span></div>
<div class="i2">The grove begins to tremble, earth to quake,</div>
<div class="i2">And all the palace totters with the shock,</div>
<div class="i2">And seems to hesitate in conscious doubt</div>
<div class="i2">Where it shall throw its ponderous masses down.</div>
<div class="i2">High on the left a star with darkling train</div>
<div class="i2">Shoots swift athwart the sky; the sacred wine</div>
<div class="i2">Poured at the altar fires, with horrid change,<span class="linenum">700</span></div>
<div class="i2">Turns bloody as it flows. The royal crown</div>
<div class="i2">Fell twice and yet again from Atreus' head,</div>
<div class="i2">And the ivory statues in the temple wept.</div>
<div class="i2">These monstrous portents moved all others sore;</div>
<div class="i2">But Atreus, only, held himself unmoved,</div>
<div class="i2">And even set the threat'ning gods at naught.</div>
<div class="i2">And now delay is at an end. He stands<span class="linenum">705</span></div>
<div class="i2">Before the shrine with lowering, sidelong gaze.</div>
<div class="i2">As in the jungle by the Ganges stream</div>
<div class="i2">A hungry tigress stands between two bulls,</div>
<div class="i2">Eager for both, but yet in doubtful mood</div>
<div class="i2">Which first shall feel her fangs (to this she turns<span class="linenum">710</span></div>
<div class="i2">With gaping jaws, then back to that again,</div>
<div class="i2">And holds her raging hunger in suspense):</div>
<div class="i2">So cruel Atreus eyes the victims doomed</div>
<div class="i2">To sate his curséd wrath; and hesitates</div>
<div class="i2">Who first shall feel the knife, and who shall die</div>
<div class="i2">The next in order. 'Tis of no concern,</div>
<div class="i2">But still he hesitates, and gloats awhile<span class="linenum">715</span></div>
<div class="i2">In planning how to do the horrid deed.</div>

<div class="i2">Clear to the hilt and drew it forth again.</div>
<div class="i2">Still stood the corpse upright, and, wavering long,</div>
<div class="i2">As 'twere in doubt or here or there to fall,<span class="linenum">725</span></div>
<div class="i2">At last prone on the uncle hurled itself.</div>
<div class="i2">Then he, his rancor unabated still,</div>

<div class="i2">With one keen blow he smote him on the neck,</div>

<div class="i2">With this inspection satisfied at length,</div>

<div class="i2">His brother's awful feast. With his own hand</div>
<div class="i2">The bodies he dismembers, carving off</div>

<div class="i2">Is placed on spits and by the roasting fires<span class="linenum">765</span></div>
<div class="i2">Hangs dripping; other parts into a pot</div>
<div class="i2">Are thrown, where on the water's seething stream</div>

<div class="i2">O all-enduring sun, though thou didst flee</div>
<div class="i2">In horror from the sight, and the radiant noon</div>
<div class="i2">Didst into darkness plunge; 'twas all too late.</div>
<div class="i2">The father tears his sons, and impiously feasts</div>
<div class="i2">On his own flesh. See, there in state he sits,</div>
<div class="i2">His hair anointed with the dripping nard,<span class="linenum">780</span></div>
<div class="i2">His senses dulled with wine. And oft the food,</div>
<div class="i2">As if in horror held, sticks in his throat.</div>
<div class="i2">In this thine evil hour one good remains,</div>
<div class="i2">One only, O Thyestes: that to know</div>
<div class="i2">Thy depth of suffering is spared to thee.</div>
<div class="i2">But even this will perish. Though the sun</div>

massive walls have been overthrown and lie darkening the sky with their still
smouldering ruins. Her heroic defenders are either slain or scattered seeking
other homes in distant lands. The victorious Greeks have gathered the
rich spoils of Troy upon the shore, among these, the Trojan women who have
suffered the usual fate of women when a city is sacked. They await the lot
which shall assign them to their Grecian lords and scatter them among the
cities of their foes. All things are ready for the start.</i></p>

Greece be safe from any future Trojan war. And thus the Trojan captives
who have so long endured the pains of war, must suffer still this double

<div class="i0"><i>Hecuba:</i> Whoe'er in royal power has put his trust,</div>
<div class="i2">And proudly lords it in his princely halls;</div>
<div class="i2">Who fears no shifting of the winds of fate,</div>
<div class="i2">But fondly gives his soul to present joys:</div>
<div class="i2">Let him my lot and thine, O Troy, behold.</div>
<div class="i2">For of a truth did fortune never show</div>
<div class="i2">In plainer wise the frailty of the prop<span class="linenum">5</span></div>
<div class="i2">That doth support a king; since by her hand</div>
<div class="i2">Brought low, behold, proud Asia's capitol,</div>
<div class="i2">The work of heavenly hands, lies desolate.</div>
<div class="i2">From many lands the warring princes came</div>

<div class="i2">Where Tigris mingles with the ruddy sea</div>
<div class="i2">His tepid waves; and where the Amazon,</div>
<div class="i2">Within the view of wandering Scythia</div>
<div class="i2">Arrays her virgin ranks by Pontus' shores.</div>
<div class="i2">Yet here, o'erthrown, our ancient city lies,</div>
<div class="i2">Herself upon herself in ruins laid;</div>
<div class="i2">Her once proud walls in smouldering heaps recline,<span class="linenum">15</span></div>
<div class="i2">Mingling their ashes with our fallen homes.</div>
<div class="i2">The palace flames on high, while far and near</div>
<div class="i2">The stately city of Assaracus</div>
<div class="i2">Is wrapped in gloomy smoke. Yet e'en the flames</div>
<div class="i2">Keep not the victor's greedy hands from spoil;</div>
<div class="i2">And Troy, though in the grasp of fiery death,</div>
<div class="i2">Is pillaged still. The face of heaven is hid</div>
<div class="i2">By that dense, wreathing smoke; the shining day,</div>
<div class="i2">As if o'erspread by some thick, lowering cloud,<span class="linenum">20</span></div>
<div class="i2">Grows black and foul beneath the ashy storm.</div>
<div class="i2">The victor stands with still unsated wrath,</div>
<div class="i2">Eyeing that stubborn town of Ilium,</div>
<div class="i2">And scarce at last forgives those ten long years</div>
<div class="i2">Of bloody strife. Anon, as he beholds</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
<div class="i2">That mighty city, though in ruins laid,</div>
<div class="i2">He starts with fear; and though he plainly sees</div>
<div class="i2">His foe o'ercome, he scarce can comprehend<span class="linenum">25</span></div>
<div class="i2">That she could be o'ercome. The Dardan spoil</div>
<div class="i2">Is heaped on high, a booty vast, which Greece,</div>
<div class="i2">In all her thousand ships, can scarce bestow.</div>
<div class="i4">Now witness, ye divinities whose face</div>
<div class="i2">Was set against our state, my fatherland</div>
<div class="i2">In ashes laid; and thou, proud king of Troy,</div>
<div class="i2">Who in thy city's overthrow hast found</div>
<div class="i2">A fitting tomb; thou shade of mighty Hector,</div>
<div class="i2">In whose proud strength abiding, Ilium stood;<span class="linenum">30</span></div>
<div class="i2">Likewise ye thronging ghosts, my children all,</div>
<div class="i2">But lesser shades: whatever ill has come;</div>
<div class="i2">Whatever Phoebus' bride with frenzied speech,</div>
<div class="i2">Though all discredited, hath prophesied;<span class="linenum">35</span></div>
<div class="i2">I, Hecuba, myself foresaw, what time,</div>
<div class="i2">With unborn child o'erweighed, I dreamed a dream</div>
<div class="i2">That I had borne a flaming brand. And though,</div>
<div class="i2">Cassandra-like, I told my fears, my warnings,</div>
<div class="i2">Like our Cassandra's words in after time,</div>
<div class="i2">Were all in vain. 'Tis not the Ithacan,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor yet his trusty comrade of the night,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor that false traitor, Sinon, who has cast</div>
<div class="i2">The flaming brands that wrought our overthrow:</div>
<div class="i2">Mine is the fire&mdash;'tis by my brands ye burn.<span class="linenum">40</span></div>
<div class="i2">But why dost thou bewail the city's fall,</div>
<div class="i2">With ancient gossip's prattle? Turn thy mind,</div>
<div class="i2">Unhappy one, to nearer woes than these.</div>
<div class="i2">Troy's fall, though sad, is ancient story now.</div>
<div class="i2">I saw the horrid slaughter of the king,</div>
<div class="i2">Defiling the holy altar with its stain,<span class="linenum">45</span></div>
<div class="i2">When bold Aeacides, with savage hand</div>
<div class="i2">Entwined in helpless Priam's hoary locks,</div>
<div class="i2">Drew back his sacred head, and thrust the sword</div>
<div class="i2">Hilt-buried in his unresisting side.</div>
<div class="i2">And when he plucked the deep-driven weapon back,</div>
<div class="i2">So weak and bloodless was our agéd king,</div>
<div class="i2">The deadly blade came almost stainless forth.<span class="linenum">50</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
<div class="i2">Whose thirst for blood had not been satisfied</div>

<div class="i2">Of life? Whom would not heavenly witnesses</div>
<div class="i2">Restrain from crime? Who would not stay his hand</div>
<div class="i2">Before the sacred altar, last resort</div>
<div class="i2">Of fallen thrones? Yet he, our noble Priam,</div>
<div class="i2">The king, and father of so many kings,</div>
<div class="i2">Lies like the merest peasant unentombed;<span class="linenum">55</span></div>
<div class="i2">And, though all Troy's aflame, there's not a brand</div>
<div class="i2">To light his pyre and give him sepulture.</div>
<div class="i2">And still the heavenly powers are not appeased.</div>
<div class="i2">Behold the urn; and, subject to its lot,</div>
<div class="i2">The maids and matrons of our princely line,</div>
<div class="i2">Who wait their future lords. To whom shall I,</div>
<div class="i2">An agéd and unprized allotment, fall?</div>
<div class="i2">One Grecian lord has fixed his longing eyes</div>

<div class="i2">To grant to him the bride of Helenus;<span class="linenum">60</span></div>
<div class="i2">Antenor's spouse is object of desire,</div>

<div class="i0"><i>Pyrrhus:</i> Now that you homeward fare, and on the sea</div>
<div class="i2">Your joyful sails would spread, my noble sire</div>
<div class="i2">Is quite forgot, though by his single hand</div>
<div class="i2">Was mighty Troy o'erthrown; for, though his death<span class="linenum">205</span></div>
<div class="i2">Some respite granted to the stricken town,</div>
<div class="i2">She stood but as some sorely smitten tree,</div>
<div class="i2">That sways uncertain, choosing where to fall.</div>
<div class="i2">Though even now ye seek to make amends</div>
<div class="i2">For your neglect, and haste to grant the thing</div>
<div class="i2">He asks, 'tis but a tardy recompense.</div>
<div class="i2">Long since, the other chieftains of the Greeks</div>
<div class="i2">Have gained their just reward. What lesser prize</div>

<div class="i2">That, though his mother bade him shun the war,</div>
<div class="i2">And spend his life in long, inglorious ease,</div>
<div class="i2">Surpassing even Pylian Nestor's years,</div>
<div class="i2">He cast his mother's shamming garments off,</div>
<div class="i2">Confessing him the hero that he was?</div>
<div class="i2">When Telephus, in pride of royal power,<span class="linenum">215</span></div>
<div class="i2">Forbade our progress through his kingdom's bounds,</div>
<div class="i2">He stained with royal blood the untried hand</div>
<div class="i2">That young Achilles raised. Yet once again</div>
<div class="i2">He felt that selfsame hand in mercy laid</div>
<div class="i2">Upon his wound to heal him of its smart.</div>
<div class="i2">Then did Eëtion, smitten sore, behold</div>
<div class="i2">His city taken and his realm o'erthrown;</div>
<div class="i2">By equal fortune fell Lyrnessus' walls,<span class="linenum">220</span></div>
<div class="i2">For safety perched upon a ridgy height,</div>
<div class="i2">Whence came that captive maid, Briseïs fair;</div>
<div class="i2">And Chrysa, too, lies low, the destined cause</div>
<div class="i2">Of royal strife; and Tenedos, and the land</div>
<div class="i2">Which on its spreading pastures feeds the flocks<span class="linenum">225</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of Thracian shepherds, Scyros; Lesbos too,</div>
<div class="i2">Upon whose rocky shore the sea in twain</div>
<div class="i2">Is cleft; and Cilla, which Apollo loved.</div>
<div class="i2">All these my father took, and eke the towns</div>
<div class="i2">Whose walls Caÿcus with his vernal flood</div>
<div class="i2">Doth wash against. This widespread overthrow</div>
<div class="i2">Of tribes, this fearful and destructive scourge,</div>
<div class="i2">That swept through many towns with whirlwind power&mdash;<span class="linenum">230</span></div>
<div class="i2">This had been glory and the height of fame</div>
<div class="i2">For other chiefs; 'twas but an incident</div>
<div class="i2">In great Achilles' journey to the war.</div>
<div class="i2">So came my father and such wars he waged</div>
<div class="i2">While but preparing war. And though I pass</div>
<div class="i2">In silence all his other merits, still</div>
<div class="i2">Would mighty Hector's death be praise enough.<span class="linenum">235</span></div>
<div class="i2">My father conquered Troy; the lesser task</div>
<div class="i2">Of pillage and destruction is your own.</div>
<div class="i2">'Tis pleasant thus to laud my noble sire</div>
<div class="i2">And all his glorious deeds pass in review:</div>
<div class="i2">Before his father's eyes did Hector lie,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
<div class="i2">Of life despoiled; and Memnon, swarthy son</div>
<div class="i2">Of bright Aurora, goddess of the dawn,</div>
<div class="i2">For whose untimely death his mother's face</div>
<div class="i2">Was sicklied o'er with grief, while day was veiled<span class="linenum">240</span></div>
<div class="i2">In darkness. When the heaven-born Memnon fell,</div>
<div class="i2">Achilles trembled at his victory;</div>
<div class="i2">For in that fall he learned the bitter truth</div>
<div class="i2">That even sons of goddesses may die.</div>
<div class="i2">Then, 'mongst our latest foes, the Amazons,</div>
<div class="i2">Fierce maidens, felt my father's deadly power.</div>
<div class="i2">So, if thou rightly estimate his deeds,</div>
<div class="i2">Thou ow'st Achilles all that he can ask,</div>
<div class="i2">E'en though he seek from Argos or Mycenae<span class="linenum">245</span></div>
<div class="i2">Some high-born maid. And dost thou hesitate</div>
<div class="i2">And haggle now, inventing scruples new,</div>
<div class="i2">And deem it barbarous to sacrifice</div>
<div class="i2">This captive maid of Troy to Peleus' son?</div>
<div class="i2">But yet for Helen's sake didst thou devote</div>
<div class="i2">Thy daughter to the sacrificial knife.</div>
<div class="i2">I make in this no new or strange request,</div>
<div class="i2">But only urge a customary rite.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Agamemnon:</i> 'Tis the common fault of youth to have no check<span class="linenum">250</span></div>
<div class="i2">On passion's force; while others feel alone</div>
<div class="i2">The sweeping rush of this first fire of youth,</div>
<div class="i2">His father's spirit urges Pyrrhus on.</div>
<div class="i2">I once endured unmoved the blustering threats</div>
<div class="i2">Of proud Achilles, swoll'n with power; and now,</div>
<div class="i2">My patience is sufficient still to bear</div>
<div class="i2">His son's abuse. Why do you seek to smirch<span class="linenum">255</span></div>
<div class="i2">With cruel murder the illustrious shade</div>
<div class="i2">Of that famed chief? 'Tis fitting first to learn</div>
<div class="i2">Within what bounds the victor may command,</div>
<div class="i2">The vanquished suffer. Never has for long</div>
<div class="i2">Unbridled power been able to endure,</div>
<div class="i2">But lasting sway the self-controlled enjoy.</div>
<div class="i2">The higher fortune raises human hopes,<span class="linenum">260</span></div>
<div class="i2">The more should fortune's favorite control</div>
<div class="i2">His vaulting pride, and tremble as he views</div>

<div class="i2">Who have uplifted him above his mates.</div>
<div class="i2">By my own course of conquest have I learned</div>
<div class="i2">That mighty kings can straightway come to naught.</div>
<div class="i2">Should Troy o'erthrown exalt us overmuch?</div>
<div class="i2">Behold, we stand today whence she has fallen.<span class="linenum">265</span></div>
<div class="i2">I own that in the past too haughtily</div>
<div class="i2">Have I my sway o'er fallen chieftains borne;</div>
<div class="i2">But thought of fortune's gift has checked my pride,</div>
<div class="i2">Since she unto another might have given</div>
<div class="i2">These selfsame gifts. O fallen king of Troy,</div>
<div class="i2">Thou mak'st me proud of conquest over thee,</div>
<div class="i2">Thou mak'st me fear that I may share thy fate.<span class="linenum">270</span></div>
<div class="i2">Why should I count the scepter anything</div>
<div class="i2">But empty honor and a tinsel show?</div>
<div class="i2">This scepter one short hour can take away,</div>
<div class="i2">Without the aid, perchance, of countless ships</div>
<div class="i2">And ten long years of war. The steps of fate</div>
<div class="i2">Do not for all advance with pace so slow.<span class="linenum">275</span></div>
<div class="i2">For me, I will confess ('tis with thy grace,</div>
<div class="i2">O land of Greece, I speak) I have desired</div>
<div class="i2">To see the pride and power of Troy brought low;</div>
<div class="i2">But that her walls and homes should be o'erthrown</div>
<div class="i2">In utter ruin have I never wished.</div>

<div class="i2">And heated by the glow of victory,</div>
<div class="i2">Within the shrouding darkness of the night,<span class="linenum">280</span></div>
<div class="i2">Cannot be held in check. If any act</div>
<div class="i2">Upon that fatal night unworthy seemed</div>
<div class="i2">Or cruel, 'twas the deed of heedless wrath,</div>
<div class="i2">And darkness which is ever fury's spur,</div>
<div class="i2">And the victorious sword, whose lust for blood,</div>
<div class="i2">When once in blood imbued, is limitless.</div>
<div class="i2">Since Troy has lost her all, seek not to grasp<span class="linenum">285</span></div>
<div class="i2">The last poor fragments that remain. Enough,</div>
<div class="i2">And more has she endured of punishment.</div>
<div class="i2">But that a maid of royal birth should fall</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The scene</span> is laid partly within and partly without the palace of Agamemnon
at Argos or Mycenae, on the day of the return of the king from
his long absence at Troy, beginning in the period of darkness just preceding
the dawn.</p>

<p class="p6"><i>The blood-feud between Atreus and Thyestes was not ended with the
terrible vengeance which Atreus wreaked upon his brother. It was yet in
fate that Thyestes should live to beget upon his own daughter a son,
Aegisthus, who should slay Atreus and bring ruin and death upon the great
Atrides, Agamemnon.</i></p>

<p><i>The Trojan war is done. And now the near approach of the victorious
king, bringing his captives and treasure home to Argos, has been announced.
But little does he dream to what a home he is returning. For Clytemnestra,
enraged at Agamemnon because he had sacrificed her daughter Iphigenia at
Aulis to appease the winds, and full of jealousy because he brings Cassandra
as her rival home, estranged also by the long-continued absence of her lord,
but most estranged by her own guilty union with Aegisthus, is now plotting
to slay Agamemnon on his return, gaining thus at once revenge and safety from
his wrath.</i></p>

<div class="i2">While east with west wind struggles, south with north.</div>

<div class="i2">Nor were we solaced in our dreadful plight</div>
<div class="i2">By open view and knowledge of our ills;</div>
<div class="i2">For darkness like the murky night of Styx</div>
<div class="i2">Hedged in our view. Yet was this darkness rent,</div>

<div class="i2">With crashing bolts. Yet e'en this fearful gleam</div>

<div class="i2">The fleet assists its own destruction, too,</div>
<div class="i2">Prow dashing hard on prow, and side on side;</div>

<div class="i2">With hand far backward drawn, like Jove himself,</div>

<div class="i2">Straight fell the bolt, and, piercing man and ship,</div>

<div class="i2">Still undismayed, he overtops the waves,</div>

<div class="i2">Still gleaming with the lightning's lurid glare,</div>
<div class="i2">He shines amid the blackness like a torch</div>
<div class="i2">Which sheds its beams afar upon the deep.</div>
<div class="i2">At length a jutting rock he gains, and shouts</div>

<h3>OCTAVIA</h3>

<p class="center">A FABULA PRAETEXTA</p>

<p class="center">THE ONLY EXTANT ROMAN HISTORICAL DRAMA</p>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
The Roman historical drama had a place among the earliest products
of Roman literature, and seems to have enjoyed a degree of popularity
through all succeeding periods. That Roman literary genius did not
find a much fuller expression through this channel was not due to a lack
of national pride and patriotism, nor yet to a dearth of interesting and
inspiring subjects in Roman history. The true reason is probably to be
found in the fact that by the time national conditions were ripe for the development
of any form of literature, the Greeks had already worked, and
well worked, nearly all available fields, and had produced a mass of literature
which dazzled the Roman mind when at last circumstances brought
these two nations into closer contact.</p>

<p>The natural and immediate result was an attempt on the part
of the Romans to imitate these great models. And hence we have in
drama, both in tragedy and comedy, a wholesale imitation of the Greek
dramas, oftentimes nothing more than a translation of these, with only
here and there an attempt to produce something of a strictly native character,
entirely independent of the Greek influence.</p>

<p>This imitative impulse was augmented by the fact that the Romans
were following the line of least resistance, since it is always easier to imitate
than to create. Furthermore, they had as yet developed no national
pride of literature to hold them to their own lines of national development;
they had no forms of their own so well established that the mere force of
literary momentum would carry them steadily on toward a fuller development,
in spite of the disturbing influences of the influx of other and better
models. They had, indeed, developed a native Saturnian verse which,
had it been allowed a free field, might have reached a high pitch of literary
excellence. But it speedily gave way at the approach of the more elegant
imported forms.</p>

<p>The overwhelming influence of Greek tragedy upon the Roman dramatists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>can be seen at a glance as we review the dramatic product of the
Roman tragedians. We have titles and fragments of nine tragedies by
Livius Andronicus, seven by Naevius, twenty-two by Ennius, thirteen by
Pacuvius, forty-six by Accius, and many unassignable fragments from
each of these which indicate numerous other plays of the same character.
To these should be added scattering additions from nearly a score
more of Roman writers during the next two hundred years after
Accius. All the above-mentioned plays are on Greek subjects; and most
of those whose fragments are sufficiently extensive to allow us to form an
opinion of their character are either translations or close imitations of the
Greeks, or are so influenced by these as to be decidedly Greek rather than
Roman in character.</p>

<p>And what of the genuine Roman dramatic product? Speaking for the
<i>fabula praetexta</i>, or Roman historical drama, alone, the entire output, so
far as our records go, is contained in the following list of authors and titles.</p>

<p>From Naevius (265-204 <small>B.C.</small>) we have the <i>Clastidium</i>, written in
celebration of the victory of Marcellus over Vidumarus, king of the Transpadane
Gauls, whom Marcellus slew and stripped of his armor, thus
gaining the rare <i>spolia opima</i>; this at Clastidium in 222 <small>B.C.</small> The
play was probably written for the especial occasion either of the triumph
of Marcellus or of the celebration of his funeral.</p>

<p>We have also from Naevius a play variously entitled <i>Lupus</i> or <i>Romulus</i>
or <i>Alimonium Remi et Romuli</i>, evidently one of those dramatic reproductions
of scenes in the life of a god, enacted as a part of the ceremonies of his
worship. These are comparable to similar dramatic representations
among the Greeks in the worship of Dionysus.
</p>
<p>The <i>Ambracia</i> and the <i>Sabinae</i> of Ennius (239-169 <small>B.C.</small>) are ordinarily
classed as <i>fabulae praetextae</i>, although Lucian Müller classes the fragments
of the <i>Ambracia</i> among the <i>Saturae</i> of Ennius; while Vahlen puts the
<i>Ambracia</i> under the heading <i>Comoediarum et ceterorum carminum reliquiae</i>,
and classifies the fragments of the <i>Sabinae</i> under <i>ex incertis saturarum
libris</i>. The <i>Ambracia</i> is evidently called after the city of that name in
Epirus, celebrated for the long and remarkable siege which it sustained
against the Romans under M. Fulvius Nobilior. That general finally
captured the city in 189 <small>B.C.</small> If the piece is to be considered as a play,
it was, like the <i>Clastidium</i>, written in honor of a Roman general, and
acted on the occasion either of his triumph or of his funeral.</p>

<p>We have four short fragments from the <i>Paulus</i> of Pacuvius (220-130
<small>B.C.</small>), written in celebration of the exploits of L. Aemilius Paulus who
conquered Perseus, king of Macedonia, in the battle of Pydna, 168 <small>B.C.</small>
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
The fragments of the plays already mentioned are too brief to afford any
adequate idea of the character or content of the plays. But in the
<i>Brutus</i> of Accius (b. 170 <small>B.C.</small>), which centers around the expulsion of the
Tarquins and the establishment of the Republic, we have a larger glimpse
into the play through two most interesting fragments consisting of twelve
iambic trimeters and ten trochaic tetrameters, respectively. In the first,
King Tarquin relates to his seer an ill-ominous dream which he has had;
the second is the seer's interpretation of this dream, pointing to Tarquin's
dethronement by Brutus. Other short fragments give glimpses of the outrage
of Lucretia by Sextus at Collatia, and the scene in the forum where
Brutus takes his oath of office as first consul. This play, unlike its predecessors,
was not written at the time of the events which it portrays, but
may still be classed with them, so far as its object is concerned, since it is
generally thought to have been written in honor of D. Junius Brutus who
was consul in 138 <small>B.C.</small>, and with whom the poet enjoyed an intimate
friendship.</p>

<p>Another <i>praetexta</i> of Accius is preserved, the <i>Decius</i>, of which eleven
short fragments remain. This play celebrates the victory of Quintus
Fabius Maximus and P. Decius Mus over the Samnites and Gauls at
Sentinum in 295 <small>B.C.</small> The climax of the play would be the self-immolation
of Decius after the example of his father in the Latin war of 340 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>In addition to these plays of the Roman dramatists of the Republic, we
have knowledge of a few which date from later times. There was a
historical drama entitled <i>Iter</i>, by L. Cornelius Balbus, who dramatized
the incidents of a journey which he made to Pompey's camp at Dyrrachium
at the opening of civil war in 49 <small>B.C.</small> Balbus was under commission from
Caesar to treat with the consul, L. Cornelius Lentulus, and other optimates
who had fled from Rome, concerning their return to the city. The journey
was a complete fiasco, so far as results were concerned; but the vanity of
Balbus was so flattered by his (to him) important mission that he must
needs dramatize his experiences and present the play under his own direction
in his native city of Gades.</p>

<p>We have mention also of an <i>Aeneas</i> by Pomponius Secundus, and of
two <i>praetextae</i> by Curiatius Maternus, entitled <i>Domitius</i> and <i>Cato</i>.
</p>
<p>These eleven historical plays are, as we have seen, for the most part,
plays of occasion, and would be at best of but temporary interest, born of
the special circumstances which inspired them. They are in no way comparable
with such historical dramas on Roman subjects as Shakespeare's
<i>Julius Caesar</i> or <i>Coriolanus</i>, whose interest is for all times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
We have still a twelfth play of this class, which enjoys the unique distinction
of being the only Roman historical drama which has come down
to us&mdash;the <i>Octavia</i>. Its authorship is unknown, although tradition gives
it a place among the tragedies of Seneca, the philosopher. The general
opinion of modern critics, however, is against this tradition, chiefly because
one passage in the play, in the form of a prophecy, too circumstantially
describes the death of Nero, which occurred three years after the death
of Seneca. It is generally agreed that the play must have been written
soon after the death of Nero, and by some one, possibly Maternus, who
had been an eye-witness of the events, and who had been inspired by his
sympathies for the unfortunate Octavia to write this story of her sufferings.</p>

<div class="i2">Whose monstrous deed posterity</div>
<div class="i2">Will scarce believe. With rage and grief<span class="linenum">360</span></div>
<div class="i2">Inflamed, he raves that still she lives,</div>
<div class="i2">His mother, snatched from the wild sea's jaws,</div>
<div class="i2">And doubles crime on impious crime.</div>
<div class="i2">Bent on his wretched mother's death,</div>
<div class="i2">He brooks no tarrying of fate.<span class="linenum">365</span></div>
<div class="i2">His willing creatures work his will,</div>
<div class="i2">And in the hapless woman's breast</div>
<div class="i2">The fatal sword is plunged; but she</div>
<div class="i2">To that fell minister of death</div>
<div class="i2">Appeals with dying tongue: "Nay here,</div>
<div class="i2">Here rather strike the murderous blow,</div>
<div class="i2">Here sheathe thy sword, deep in the womb<span class="linenum">370</span></div>
<div class="i2">Which such a monster bore."</div>
<div class="i2">So spake the dying queen, her words</div>
<div class="i2">And groans commingling. So at last</div>
<div class="i2">Through gaping wounds her spirit fled<span class="linenum">375</span></div>
<div class="i2">In grief and agony.</div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><i>Seneca</i> [<i>alone</i>]: Why hast thou, potent Fate, with flattering looks,</div>
<div class="i2">Exalted me, contented with my lot,</div>
<div class="i2">That so from this great height I might descend</div>
<div class="i2">With heavier fall, and wider prospect see<span class="linenum">380</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of deadly fears? Ah, better was I, hid</div>
<div class="i2">Far from the stinging lash of envy's tongue,</div>
<div class="i2">Amid the lonely crags of Corsica.</div>
<div class="i2">There was my spirit free to act at will,</div>
<div class="i2">Was master of itself, had time to think</div>
<div class="i2">And meditate at length each favorite theme.</div>
<div class="i2">Oh, what delight, than which none greater is,<span class="linenum">385</span></div>
<div class="i2">Of all that mother nature hath produced,</div>
<div class="i2">To watch the heavens, the bright sun's sacred rounds,</div>
<div class="i2">The heavenly movements and the changing night,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
<div class="i2">The moon's full orb with wandering stars begirt,</div>
<div class="i2">The far-effulgent glory of the sky!<span class="linenum">390</span></div>
<div class="i2">And is it growing old, this structure vast,</div>
<div class="i2">Doomed to return to groping nothingness?</div>
<div class="i2">Then must that final doomsday be at hand,</div>
<div class="i2">That shall by heaven's fall o'erwhelm a race</div>
<div class="i2">So impious, that thus the world may see</div>
<div class="i2">A newer race of men, a better stock,<span class="linenum">395</span></div>
<div class="i2">Which once the golden reign of Saturn knew.</div>
<div class="i2">Then virgin Justice, holy child of heaven,</div>
<div class="i2">In mercy ruled the world; the race of men</div>
<div class="i2">Knew naught of war, the trumpet's savage blare,<span class="linenum">400</span></div>
<div class="i2">The clang of arms; not yet were cities hedged</div>
<div class="i2">With ponderous walls; the way was free to all,</div>
<div class="i2">And free to all the use of everything.</div>
<div class="i2">The earth, untilled, spread wide her fertile lap,<span class="linenum">405</span></div>
<div class="i2">The happy mother of a pious stock.</div>
<div class="i2">Then rose another race of sterner mold;</div>
<div class="i2">Another yet to curious arts inclined,</div>
<div class="i2">But pious still; a fourth of restless mood,</div>
<div class="i2">Which lusted to pursue the savage beasts,<span class="linenum">410</span></div>
<div class="i2">To draw the fishes from their sheltering waves</div>
<div class="i2">With net or slender pole, to snare the birds,</div>
<div class="i2">To force the headstrong bullocks to endure</div>
<div class="i2">The bondage of the yoke, to plow the earth</div>
<div class="i2">Which never yet had felt the share's deep wound,</div>
<div class="i2">And which in pain and grief now hid her fruits</div>
<div class="i2">Within her sacred bosom's safer hold.<span class="linenum">415</span></div>
<div class="i2">Now deep within the bowels of the earth</div>
<div class="i2">Did that debased, unfilial age intrude;</div>
<div class="i2">And thence it dug the deadly iron and gold,</div>
<div class="i2">And soon it armed its savage hands for war.</div>
<div class="i2">It fixed the bounds of realms, constructed towns,<span class="linenum">420</span></div>
<div class="i2">Fought for its own abodes, or threat'ning strove</div>
<div class="i2">To plunder those of others as a prize.</div>
<div class="i2">Then did abandoned Justice, heavenly maid,</div>
<div class="i2">In terror flee the earth, the bestial ways</div>
<div class="i2">Of men, their hands with bloody slaughter stained,</div>
<div class="i2">And, fixed in heaven, now shines among the stars.<span class="linenum">425</span></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
<div class="i2">Then lust of war increased, and greed for gold,</div>
<div class="i2">Throughout the world; and luxury arose,</div>
<div class="i2">That deadliest of evils, luring pest,</div>
<div class="i2">To whose fell powers new strength and force were given</div>
<div class="i2">By custom long observed, and precedent</div>
<div class="i2">Of evil into worser evil led.</div>
<div class="i2">This flood of vice, through many ages dammed,<span class="linenum">430</span></div>
<div class="i2">In ours has burst its bounds and overflowed.</div>
<div class="i2">By this dire age we're fairly overwhelmed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">An age when crime sits regnant on the throne,</div>
<div class="i2">Impiety stalks raging, unrestrained;</div>
<div class="i2">Foul lust, with all unbridled power, is queen,</div>
<div class="i2">And luxury long since with greedy hands</div>
<div class="i2">Has snatched the boundless riches of the world,<span class="linenum">435</span></div>
<div class="i2">That she with equal greed may squander them.</div>

<div class="dir">[<i>Enter</i> Nero, <i>followed by a</i> Prefect.]</div>

<div class="i2">But see, with frenzied step and savage mien,</div>
<div class="i2">The prince approaches. How I fear his will.</div>

COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OF SENECA'S TRAGEDIES AND
THE CORRESPONDING GREEK DRAMAS</p>

<p>The <i>Phoenissae</i>, if, indeed, these fragments are to be considered as
belonging to one play, has no direct correspondent in Greek drama;
although, in the general situations and in some details, it is similar to
parts of three plays: <i>The Seven Against Thebes</i> of Aeschylus, the <i>Oedipus
at Colonus</i> of Sophocles, and the <i>Phoenician Damsels</i> of Euripides. The
<i>Thyestes</i> is without a parallel in extant Greek drama; and the <i>Octavia</i>,
of course, stands alone.</p>

<p>The other seven tragedies attributed by tradition to Seneca, together
with their Greek correspondents, are here presented in comparative analyses
in order that the reader may be enabled easily to compare, at least so far
as subject-matter and dramatic structure are concerned, the Roman
tragedies and their Greek originals.</p>

<p>Although the traditional division into acts is followed in the English
version of the several plays, it seems wise in these comparisons to give
the more minute division into prologue, episodes, and choral interludes.</p>

<h3>THE <i>OEDIPUS</i> OF SOPHOCLES, AND THE <i>OEDIPUS</i> OF
SENECA</h3>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Dialogue between Oedipus
and the priest of Zeus, who discloses
the present plague-smitten condition
of the people, and prays the king for
aid since he is so wise. The fatherly
regard of Oedipus for his people, in
that he has already sent a messenger
to ask the aid of the oracle, is portrayed.</p>

<p>The answer of the oracle: first reference
to an unexpiated sin. Short
question and answer between Oedipus
and Creon, the messenger, bringing
out the facts of Laïus' death.</p>

<p>The irony of fate: Oedipus proposes,
partly in his own interest, to
seek out the murderer. As yet there
is no foreshadowing of evil in the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
mind. At the end of the prologue Oedipus
remains alone upon the stage.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;In the early morning
Oedipus is seen lamenting the plague-smitten
condition of his people. He
narrates how he had fled from Corinth
to avoid the fulfilment of a dreadful
oracle, that he should kill his father
and wed his mother. Even here he
cannot feel safe, but still fears some
dreadful fate that seems threatening.
He describes with minute detail the
terrors of the pestilence which has
smitten man and beast and even the
vegetable world. He prays for death
that he may not survive his stricken
people. Jocasta remonstrates with
him for his despair and reminds him
that it is a king's duty to bear
reverses with cheerfulness. </p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
enlarges upon the distresses of the
city, and appeals to the gods for aid.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
appeals to Bacchus, relating how the
descendants of his old Theban comrades
are perishing. It enlarges upon
the distresses of the city, and deplores
the violence of the plague. The sufferings
of the people are described in
minute detail.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original"><p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;The curse of Oedipus
upon the unknown murderer
is pronounced, and the charge is made
by Tiresias (who long refuses to speak
but is forced to do so by Oedipus),
"Thou art the man." Oedipus'
explanation of Tiresias' charge; it is
a plot between the latter and Creon.
The facts of Oedipus' birth are hinted
at. Tiresias prophesies the after-life
of the king, with the name but thinly
veiled.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Creon, returned
from the consultation of the oracle at
Delphi, announces that the plague is
caused by the unatoned murder of
Laïus, former king of Thebes. Oedipus
anxiously inquires who the murderer
is, but is told that this is still a
mystery. Creon describes the scene
at Delphi in the giving of the oracle.
Oedipus declares himself eager to
hunt out the murderer and inquires
why the matter has been left so long
uninvestigated. He is told that the
terrors of the Sphinx had driven all
other thoughts out of the people's
mind.</p>

<p>The irony of fate: Oedipus pronounces
a dreadful curse upon the
murderer of Laïus and vows not to
rest until he finds him. He inquires
where the murder took place and
how. At this moment the blind old
Tiresias enters, led by his daughter,
Manto. Tiresias tries by the arts of
divination (which are described with
the greatest elaboration) to ascertain
the name of the murderer, but without
avail; and says that recourse
must be had to necromancy, or the
raising of the dead. </p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
reflects upon the oracle and the certain
discovery of the guilty one. Ideal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
picture of the flight of the murderer.
While troubled by the charge of Tiresias,
the chorus still refuses to give it
credence. After all, the seer is only
a man and liable to be mistaken.
Oedipus has shown himself a wiser
man by solving the riddle of the
Sphinx.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
sings a dithyrambic strain in praise of
the wonderful works of Bacchus. No
reference is made to the tragedy
which is in progress.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Quarrel of Oedipus
and Creon based upon the charges
of the former. Oedipus' argument:
The deed was done long ago, and
Tiresias, though then also a seer, made
no charge. Now, when forced by the
recent oracle, the seer comes forward
with Creon. This looks like a conspiracy.
Creon pleads for a fair and
complete investigation. Jocasta tries
to reconcile the two, but in vain, and
Creon is driven out. Jocasta relates
the circumstances of Laïus' death,
which tally in all details but one with
the death of one slain by Oedipus. A
terrible conclusion begins to dawn
upon the king. He tells his queen
the story of his life and the dreadful
oracle, the fear of the fulfilment of
which drove him from Corinth. At
the end of this episode the death of
Laïus at the hands of Oedipus is all
but proved, but the relation between
the two is not yet hinted at.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Creon returns from
the rites of necromancy in which he
had accompanied Tiresias, and strives
to avoid telling the result of the investigation
to the king. Being at last
forced to reveal all that he knows, he
describes with great vividness of
detail how Tiresias has summoned
up the spirits of the dead, and among
them Laïus. The latter declares
that Oedipus himself is the murderer,
having slain his father and married
his mother. Oedipus, strong in the
belief that Polybus and Merope of
Corinth are his parents, denies the
charge, and after a hot dispute orders
Creon to be cast into prison, on suspicion
of a conspiracy with Tiresias
to deprive Oedipus of the scepter.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;Prayer for
a life in accordance with the will of
heaven. Under the shadow of impending
ill, the chorus seeks the aid
of God, meditates upon the doom of
the unrighteous, and considers the
seeming fallibility of the oracle.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
refuses to believe the charge
against Oedipus, but lays the blame
of all these ills upon the evil fate of
Thebes which has pursued the Thebans
from the first.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;A messenger from
Corinth brings the news of Polybus'
death, the supposed father of Oedipus.
The irony of fate: the king is lifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
up with joy that now the oracle cannot
be fulfilled that he should kill his own
father. Step by step the details of
the king's infancy come out, which
reveal the awful truth to Jocasta. To
Oedipus the only result of the present
revelation is that he is probably base-born.
Jocasta tries to deter Oedipus
from further investigation.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Oedipus, remembering
that he had slain a man on his
way to Thebes, questions Jocasta
more closely as to the circumstances
of Laïus' death, and finding these
circumstances to tally with his own
experience, is convinced that he was
indeed the slayer of Laïus.</p>

<p>At this point a messenger from
Corinth, an old man, announces to
Oedipus the death of Polybus, the
king of Corinth, and the supposed
father of Oedipus. The latter is summoned
to the empty throne of Corinth.
A quick succession of questions and
answers brings to light the fact that
Oedipus is not the child of Polybus
and Merope, but that the messenger
himself had given him when
an infant to the Corinthian pair.
This announcement removes the
chief support of Oedipus against the
charges of Tiresias, and now he rushes
blindly on to know the rest of the
fatal truth. The shepherd is summoned
who had given the baby to
the old Corinthian. He strives to
avoid answering, but, driven on by the
threats of Oedipus, he at last states
that he had received the child from
the royal household of Thebes, and
that it was in fact the son of Jocasta.
At this last and awful disclosure,
Oedipus goes off the stage in a fit of
raving madness.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Strophe and antistrophe.</i>&mdash;A partial
interlude, while they wait for the shepherd
who is to furnish the last link in
the chain of evidence. The chorus
conjectures as to the wonderful birth
of Oedipus; possibly his father is Pan,
or Apollo, or Mercury, or Bacchus.</p>

<p>The shepherd, arriving, also seeks
to keep the dreadful truth from the
king, but a second time the passion of
Oedipus forces the truth from an
unwilling witness. At last the whole
story comes out, and Oedipus realizes
that he has slain his father and wed
his mother.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The utter
nothingness of human life, judged by
the fate of Oedipus, who above all
men was successful, wise, and good.
It is inscrutable; why should such a
fate come to him? The chorus
laments the doom of the king as its
own.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
reflects upon the dangerous position
of the man who is unduly exalted, and
illustrates this principle by the case of
Icarus.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original"><p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;The catastrophe in its final
manifestations. A messenger describes
the lamentations and suicide
of Jocasta, the despair of Oedipus, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
the wild mood in which he inflicts
blindness upon himself. He comes
upon the stage piteously wailing and
groping his way. He prays for death
or banishment at the hands of Creon,
who is now king. He takes a tender
farewell of his daughters and consigns
them to Creon's care.</p>

<p>The play ends with the solemn
warning of the chorus "to reckon no
man happy till ye witness the closing
day; until he pass the border which
severs life from death, unscathed by
sorrow."</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;Although there is a short
chorus interjected here (lines 980-97)
on the inevitableness of fate, all the
remainder of the play is really the
exode, showing the catastrophe in its
final manifestation. A messenger
describes with horrible minuteness
how Oedipus in his ravings has dug
out his eyes. At this point Oedipus
himself comes upon the stage, rejoicing
in his blindness, since now he can
never look upon his shame. And
now Jocasta appears, having heard
strange rumors. On learning the
whole truth, she slays herself on the
stage with Oedipus' sword. The play
ends as the blind old king goes groping
his way out into darkness and
exile.</p></div>

<h3>THE <i>MEDEA</i> OF EURIPIDES, AND THE <i>MEDEA</i> OF SENECA</h3>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original"><p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;The old nurse of Medea,
alone upon the stage, laments that
the Argo was ever framed and that
Medea had ever fled from Colchis.
Then had she never been here in
Corinth an exile and now deserted
even by her husband, Jason. In
describing Medea's distracted condition,
the nurse first voices the fear of
that violence which forms the catastrophe
of the play. Enter an old
attendant with the two sons of Medea,
who announces a new woe&mdash;that
Creon, the king, has decreed the banishment
of Medea and her children.
The nurse repeats her warning note,
and urges the attendant to keep the
children out of the sight of their
mother, who even now can be heard
raving within, and vowing the destruction
of her children and her husband.
The attendant retires with the children.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Medea, finding herself
deserted by Jason, calls upon gods and
furies to grant her vengeance. She
prays for destruction to light upon her
rival, and imprecates curses upon
Jason. She thinks it monstrous that
the sun can still hold on his way, and
prays for power to subvert the whole
course of nature. She finally realizes
that she is impotent save as she has
recourse to her old sorceries which she
has long since laid aside, and resolves
upon them as a means of revenge.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
of Corinthian women comes to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
front of the palace to inquire the
cause of Medea's cries, which they
have heard, and to profess their
attachment to her. From time to
time Medea's voice can be heard from
within as she prays for death and
imprecates curses upon Jason. The
nurse at the suggestion of the chorus
undertakes to induce her mistress to
come forth, that converse with her
friends may soothe her grief. The
nurse goes within, leaving the chorus
alone upon the stage.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;A chorus
of Corinthians chants an epithalamium
for the nuptials of Jason and Creüsa.
First, in Asclepiadean strains, they
invoke the gods to be present and bless
the nuptials. The strain then changes
to quick, joyful Glyconics in praise of
the surpassing beauty of the married
pair. Changing back to Asclepiads,
the chorus continues in extravagant
praise of Jason and his bride, congratulates
him on his exchange from
Medea to Creüsa, and finally, in six
lines of hexameter, exults in the license
of the hour.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Medea comes forth
from the palace to explain to the
chorus her position and unhappy
condition. She deplores the lot of
women in general, and especially in
relation to marriage, and enlists the
sympathy of the chorus in her attempt
to secure some revenge for her wrongs.
They confess the justice of her cause
and promise to keep her secret.</p>

<p>Creon announces to Medea that
she must leave his realm at once, for
much he fears that she will take her
revenge upon him and upon his house.
She pleads for grace, and bewails her
reputation for magic power; she
assures the king that he has nothing
to fear from her, and affects compliance
with all that has taken place.
Creon, while still protesting that she
cannot be trusted, yields in so far
that he grants her a single day's
delay.</p>

<p>Medea tells the chorus that her
recent compliance was only feigned,
and openly announces her intention
before the day is done of slaying
Creon, his daughter, and Jason. She
debates the various methods by which
this may be accomplished, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
decides, for her own greater safety,
upon the help of magic.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Hearing the epithalamium,
Medea goes into a passion of
rage. She recounts all that she has
done for Jason, and exclaims against
his ingratitude. Again, with shifting
feelings she pleads Jason's cause to
herself and strives to excuse him, blaming
all upon Creon. Upon him she
vows the direst vengeance. Meanwhile
the nurse in vain urges prudence.</p>

<p>Creon now enters, manifesting in
his words a fear of Medea, and bent
upon her immediate banishment.
Medea pleads her innocence, and begs
to know the reason for her exile. She
reviews at length her former regal
estate and contrasts with this her
present forlorn condition. She claims
the credit for the preservation of all
the Argonautic heroes. Upon this
ground she claims that Jason is hers.
She begs of Creon some small corner
in his kingdom for her dwelling, but
the king remains obdurate. She then
prays for a single day's delay in which
to say farewell to her children, who are
to remain, the wards of the king. This
prayer Creon reluctantly grants.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The course
of nature is subverted. No longer
let woman alone have the reputation
for falsehood; man's insincerity equals
hers. In poetry the fickleness of both
should be sung, just as in history it is
seen. Though Medea, for her love of
Jason, left her native land and braved
all the terrors of the deep, she is now
left all forsaken and alone. Verily
truth and honor have departed from
the earth.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;Apropos of
Medea's reference to the Argonautic
heroes the chorus sings of the dangers
which those first voyagers upon the
sea endured; how the natural bounds
which the gods set to separate the
lands have now been removed&mdash;and
all this for gold and this barbarian
woman. (The chorus is nowhere
friendly to Medea, as in Euripides.)
The ode ends with a prophecy of the
time when all the earth shall be revealed,
and there shall be no "Ultima
Thule."</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Jason reproaches
Medea for her intemperate speech
against the king, which has resulted
in her banishment, and shows her
that he is still concerned for her interests.
She retorts with reproaches
because of his ingratitude, and proceeds
to recount all that she had done
for him and given up in his behalf.
Jason replies that it was not through
her help but that of Venus that he had
escaped all the perils of the past, and
reminds her of the advantages which
she herself had gained by leaving her
barbarous land for Greece. He even
holds that his marriage into the royal
family of Corinth is in her interest
and that of her children, since by
this means their common fortunes
will be mended. He offers her from
his new resources assistance for her
exile, which she indignantly refuses,
and Jason retires from her bitter
taunts.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Medea is rushing
out to seek vengeance, while the nurse
tries in vain to restrain her. The
nurse soliloquizes, describing the wild
frenzy of her mistress, and expressing
grave fears for the result. Medea, not
noticing the nurse's presence, reflects
upon the day that has been granted
her by Creon, and vows that her terrible
vengeance shall be commensurate
with her sufferings. She rushes off
the stage, while the nurse calls after
her a last warning.</p>

<p>Jason now enters, lamenting the
difficult position in which he finds
himself. He asserts that it is for his
children's sake that he has done all,
and hopes to be able to persuade Medea
herself to take this view. Medea
comes back, and at sight of Jason her
fury is still further inflamed. She
announces her intended flight. But
whither shall she flee? For his sake
she has closed all lands against herself.
In bitter sarcasm she accepts
all these sufferings as her just punishment.
Then in a flash of fury she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
recalls all her services to him and contrasts
his ingratitude. She shifts
suddenly to passionate entreaty, and
prays him to pity her, to give back all
that she gave up for him, if she must
needs flee; she begs him to brave the
wrath of Creon and flee with her, and
promises him her protection as of old.
In a long series of quick, short passages
they shift from phase to phase of
feeling, and finally Medea prays that
in her flight she may have her children
as her comrades. Jason's refusal
shows how deeply he loves his sons,
and here is suggested to Medea for
the first time the method of her direst
revenge. Jason now yields to her
assumed penitence and grants her the
custody of the children for this day
alone. When Jason has withdrawn,
she bids the nurse prepare the fatal
robe which she proposes to send to her
rival by the hands of her children.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
prays to be delivered from the pangs
of immoderate love and jealousy, from
exile, and the ingratitude of friends.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
opens on the text, "Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned," and continues
with a prayer for Jason's safety. It
then recounts the subsequent history
of the individual Argonauts, showing
how almost all came to some untimely
end. They might indeed be said to
deserve this fate, for they volunteered
to assist in that first impious voyage
in quest of the golden fleece; but Jason
should be spared the general doom,
for the task had been imposed upon
him by his usurping uncle, Pelias.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third, episode.</i>&mdash;Aegeus, in Corinth
by accident, recognizes Medea, and
learns from her her present grievous
condition and imminent exile. She
begs that he receive her into his kingdom
as a friend under his protection.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
This he promises with a mighty oath
to do.</p>

<p>Medea, left alone with the chorus,
explains to it still more in detail her
plans. She will send her sons with
gifts to the new bride, which, by their
magic power, will destroy her and all
who touch her. She adds that she
will also slay her two sons, the more
to injure Jason. The chorus, while
protesting against this last proposal,
offers no resistance.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;The nurse in a long
monologue recites Medea's magic
wonders of the past, and all her present
preparations. Then Medea's voice is
heard, and presently she comes upon
the stage chanting her incantations.
She summons up the gods of Tartara
to aid her task; recounts all the
wonders which her charms can work;
describes her store of magic fires and
other potent objects. Then breaking
into quicker measure, as if filled with
a fuller frenzy, she continues her incantations
accompanied by wild cries
and gestures. She finally dispatches
her sons to Jason's bride with the robe
she has anointed with her magic drugs
and charged with her curses. She
hastens out in the opposite direction.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus,
dwelling upon Medea's proposed
place of refuge, sings the praises of
Athens, sacred to the Muses. It
contrasts with this holy city the dreadful
deed which Medea intends, and
again vainly strives to dissuade her.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
notes and describes Medea's wild
bearing, and prays for her speedy
departure from their city.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Fourth episode.</i>&mdash;Medea, sending
for Jason, with feigned humility
reproaches herself for her former
intemperate words to him, and begs
only that he use his influence for the
reprieve of their children from exile.
To assist him in this, she proposes to
send the children themselves, bearing
a gorgeous robe of golden tissue
(which she has anointed with magic
poison) as a wedding present to the
bride. Upon this errand Jason retires
attended by his little sons.</p>

<p><i>Fourth choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus,
with full knowledge of the fatal
robe, pictures the delight of the bride
at its reception, and laments her fearful
doom.</p>

<p><i>Fifth episode.</i>&mdash;This episode is in
four parts.</p>

<p>The attendant returns with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>children and announces to Medea
that her gifts have prevailed for their
reprieve. (The attendant retires.)</p>

<p>Medea contrasts the assured career
of her children with her own hapless
condition; then remembers her resolve
and with softening heart laments their
dreadful fate. She hastily sends
them within the palace. Left alone,
she again struggles between her
mother-love and her resolve not to
leave her children subject to the scorn
of her foes. (She here leaves the
stage to wait for tidings from the
royal house.)</p>

<p>Then follows a monologue by the
chorus leader discussing the advantages
of childlessness. No reference
is made to the passing events.</p>

<p>Medea returns just in time to meet
a messenger who breathlessly announces
the death of Creon and his
daughter. At the request of Medea
he gives a detailed account of the
reception of the magic robe and
crown, the bride's delight, and her
sudden and awful death, in which
her father also was involved. He
urges Medea to fly at once. She announces
her intention to do so as
soon as she has slain her children;
and then rushes into the house.</p>

<p><i>Fifth choral interlude.</i>&mdash;This consists
of a single strophe and antistrophe
in which the chorus calls upon
the gods to restrain Medea's mad act.
Then are heard within the house the
shrieks first of the two children, then
of one, then silence, the chorus meanwhile
wildly shouting to Medea to
desist from her deadly work.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>The exode.</i>&mdash;Jason appears in search
of Medea that he may avenge on her
the death of the royal pair; but most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
he fears for his children. The chorus
informs him that they are already
slain within the palace by their
mother's hand. He prepares to force
an entrance into the house.</p>

<p>But now Medea appears in a chariot
drawn by dragons. She defies Jason's
power to harm her. Jason replies by
reproaching her with all the murderous
deeds of her life, which have culminated
in this crowning deed of
blood. She in turn reproaches him
and his ingratitude as the cause of all.
A storm of mutual imprecations follows,
and Medea disappears with the
bodies of her two sons, denying to
Jason even the comfort of weeping
over their remains.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>The exode.</i>&mdash;A messenger comes
running in from the direction of the
palace, and announces that the king
and his daughter are dead. The
eager questions of the chorus bring
out the strange circumstances attending
this catastrophe. Medea enters
in time to hear that her magic has been
successful, and ignoring the nurse's
entreaties to flee at once, she becomes
absorbed in her own reflections. And
now in her words may be seen the inward
struggle between maternal love
and jealous hate as she nerves herself
for the final act of vengeance. The
purpose to kill her children grows
upon her, resist it as she may, until in
an ecstasy of madness, urged on by a
vision of her murdered brother, she
slays her first son; and then, bearing
the corpse of one and leading the other
by the hand, she mounts to the turret of
her house. Here with a refinement
of cruelty she slays the second son in
Jason's sight, disregarding his abject
prayers for the boy's life. Now a
chariot drawn by dragons appears in
the air. This Medea mounts and is
borne away, while Jason shouts his
impotent curses after her.</p></div>

<h3>THE <i>HERCULES FURENS</i> OF EURIPIDES, AND THE <i>HERCULES
FURENS</i> OF SENECA</h3>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;The old Amphitryon,
before the altar of Jupiter, at the entrance
of the house of Hercules in
Thebes, relates how Hercules has gone
to the lower world to bring thence to
the realms of day the triple-headed
Cerberus. Meanwhile, Lycus, taking
advantage of the hero's absence, has
slain king Creon and usurped his
throne. The father, wife, and children
of Hercules he has reduced to poverty,
and holds them in durance here in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
Thebes, threatening to slay the sons,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Lest, when the boys attain maturer age,</div>
<div class="i0">They should avenge their grandsire, Creon's, death.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Amphitryon condoles with Megara,
and counsels with her how they may
escape the dangers of their present lot.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Juno complains that she
is fairly driven out of heaven by her
numerous rivals, mortal women who
have been deified and set in the sky,
either they or their offspring, by
Jupiter. Especially is her wrath hot
against Hercules, against whom she
has waged fruitless war from his infancy
until now. But he thrives on
hardship, and scorns her opposition.
She passes in review the hard tasks
which she has set him, and all of
which he has triumphantly performed.
Already is he claiming a place in
heaven. He can be conquered only
by his own hand. Yes, this shall be
turned against him, for a fury shall be
summoned up from hell who shall
fill his heart with madness; and in this
madness shall he do deeds which shall
make him long for death.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
of Theban elders, feeble, tottering
old men, enters and bemoans the
wretched fate that has befallen their
city and the household of their prince.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;A vivid
picture of the dawning day, when the
stars and waning moon fade out before
the rising sun; when Toil wakes up
and resumes its daily cares; when
through the fields the animals and
birds are all astir with glad, new
life.</p>

<p>But in the cities men awaken to
repeat the sordid round of toil, the
greedy quest for gold and power. But,
whether happily or unhappily, all are
speeding down to the world of shades.
Even before his time has Hercules
gone down to Pluto's realm, and has
not yet returned.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>First episode</i>.&mdash;Now enters Lycus,
the usurper. He insolently taunts his
victims on their helplessness, tells them
that Hercules will never return, belittles
and scorns the hero's mighty
deeds, and announces his intention of
killing the sons.</p>

<p>Amphitryon answers the slanders of
Lycus against Hercules, and protests
against the proposed barbarous treatment
of the children, who are innocent
of any harm. He reproaches
Thebes and all the land of Greece,
because they have so ill repaid the
services of their deliverer in not coming
to the rescue of his wife and
children. Lycus gives orders to burn
the hated race of Hercules, even where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
they kneel for refuge at the altar-side;
and threatens the elders who would
thwart his will, bidding them remember
that they are but as slaves in his sight.
Yet the old men valiantly defy him, and
warn him that they will withstand his
attacks upon the children.</p>

<p>But Megara shows them how foolish
it is to contend against the king's
unbounded power. Let them rather
entreat his mercy. Could not exile be
substituted for death? But no, for
this is worse than death. Rather,
let them all die together. Perhaps
Lycus will allow her to go into the
palace and deck her children in funeral
garments? This prayer is granted,
though Lycus warns them that they
are to die at once. Left alone, Amphitryon
chides Jupiter because he
does not care for the children of his
son:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">Thou know'st not how</div>
<div class="i0">To save thy friends. Thou surely art a god,</div>
<div class="i0">Either devoid of wisdom, or unjust.</div>
</div></div></div>
</div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Megara enters and
bewails the fresh woes that are ever
ready to meet her husband's home-coming.
She recounts the incidents
of his long and difficult career, his
heroic suffering at Juno's bidding.</p>

<p>And now base Lycus has taken
advantage of her husband's absence
in the lower world to kill her father,
Creon, king of Thebes, and all his sons,
and to usurp the throne&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">And Lycus rules the Thebes of Hercules!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She prays her husband soon to come
and right these wrongs, though in her
heart she fears that he will never come
again.</p>

<p>Old Amphitryon tries to reassure
her by recalling the superhuman
valor and strength of Hercules, but
without success.</p>

<p>Now Lycus appears, boasting of the
power which he has gained, not by
long descent from a noble line, but by
his own valor. But his house cannot
stand by valor alone. He must
strengthen his power by union with
some princely house&mdash;he will marry
Megara! Should she refuse, he will
give to utter ruin all the house of
Hercules.</p>

<p>Meeting her at the moment, he
attempts with specious arguments to
persuade her to his plan. But Megara
repulses his monstrous proposition
with indignant scorn. Lycus
attempts to defend his slaughter of
her father and brother as done through
the exigency of war, and pleads with
her to put away her wrath; but all
in vain, and in the end he bids his
attendants heap high a funeral pyre
on which to burn the woman and all
her brood.</p>

<p>When Lycus has retired, Amphitryon
in his extremity prays to heaven for
aid; but suddenly checks himself with
incredulous joy, for he hears approaching
the well-known step of Hercules!</p>
</div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
sings in praise of the mighty works of
Hercules, describing these in picturesque
detail, from the destruction of
the Nemean lion to his last adventure
which has taken him to the world of
shades, whence, alas, he will never
more return. And meanwhile, lacking
his protection, his friends and
family are plunged in hopeless misery.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;Verily fortune
is unjust, for while Eurystheus
sits at ease, the nobler Hercules must
suffer unending hardships. His labors
are briefly recapitulated. Now has he
gone to hell to bring back Cerberus.
Oh, that he may conquer death as all
things else, and come back again, as
did Orpheus by the charm of his lyre.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Forth from the
palace, all dressed in the garb of death,
come Megara and her children. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
is ready for the doom which has been
pronounced upon them. She sadly
recalls the fond hopes that she and her
husband had cherished for these sons.
But these bright prospects have vanished
now, for death is waiting to claim
them all, herself as well. She will fold
them in a last motherly embrace, and
pour out her grief:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">How, like the bee with variegated wings,</div>
<div class="i0">Shall I collect the sorrows of you all,</div>
<div class="i0">And blend the whole together in a flood</div>
<div class="i6">Of tears exhaustless!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But perhaps even yet her absent lord
has power to intervene in her behalf,
though he be but a ghost. She prays
despairingly that he will come to aid.
Amphitryon would try the favor of Jove
once more in this extremity:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I call on thee, O Jove, that, if thou mean</div>
<div class="i0">To be a friend to these deserted children,</div>
<div class="i0">Thou interpose without delay and save them;</div>
<div class="i0">For soon 'twill be no longer in thy power.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But at this juncture, when no help
seems possible from heaven or hell,
to their amazed joy, Hercules himself
appears, and in the flesh. He perceives
the mourning garments of his
family, and the grief-stricken faces of
the chorus, and quickly learns the
cause of all this woe. He at once
plans vengeance upon the wretch who
has wrought it all. He has, himself,
forewarned by a "bird of evil omen
perched aloft," entered Thebes in
secret; and now he will hide within
his own palace and wait until Lycus
comes to fetch the victims whom he
has doomed to death. But first he
briefly replies to Amphitryon's questions
as to the success of his errand
to the lower world.</p>
</div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Hercules enters,
fresh from the lower world, rejoicing
that he again beholds the light of day,
and exulting in the accomplishment
of his latest and most difficult task;
when suddenly he notices soldiers on
guard, and his wife and children
dressed in mourning garments. He
asks what these things mean. Amphitryon
answers briefly that Lycus
has killed Creon and his sons, usurped
the throne, and now has doomed
Megara and her children to death.</p>

<p>Hercules leaves his home at once to
find, and take vengeance on, his enemy,
though Theseus, whom he has rescued
from the world of shades, begs for the
privilege himself of slaying Lycus.
Left with Amphitryon, in reply to the
latter's questions, Theseus gives in
great detail an account of the lower
world, its way of approach, its topography,
and the various creatures who
dwell within its bounds. After describing
in particular the operations of
justice and the punishment of the
condemned, he tells how Hercules
overcame Cerberus and brought him
to the upper world.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The old

<div class="i2">But now a burden on my head</div>
<div class="i0">Heavier than Aetna's rock, old age, I bear.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They hold that had the gods been wiser
they would have given renewed youth
as a reward to the virtuous, leaving the
degenerate to fall asleep and wake no
more. And yet, though oppressed by
age, they still may "breathe the strain
Mnemosyne inspires," and sing unceasingly
the deeds of Hercules:</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus, with Theseus' words in mind,
dwell in fancy still upon the lower
world. They follow Hercules along
"that dark way, which to the distant
manes leads," and picture the
thronging shades, the "repulsive
glooms," and the "weary inactivity of
that still, empty universe." They
pray that it may be long ere they
must go to that dread world, to which
all the wandering tribes of earth must
surely come. But away with gloomy
thoughts! Now is the time for joy,
for Hercules is come again. Let
animals and men make holiday, and
fitly celebrate their prince's world-wide
victories, and their own deliverance
from their recent woes.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Lycus enters and
encounters Amphitryon without the
palace. Him he bids to go within
and bring out the victims to their
death. To this Amphitryon objects
on the ground that it would make
him an accomplice in their murder.
Whereupon Lycus enters the palace
to do his own errand. The old man,
looking after him, exclaims:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Depart; for to that place the fates ordain</div>
<div class="i0">You now are on the road;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>while the chorus rejoices that now the
oppressor is so soon to meet his just
punishment. Now the despairing cries
of Lycus are heard within and then&mdash;silence.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Hercules returns to
his house, fresh from the slaying of
Lycus, and proceeds to offer sacrifices
of thanksgiving to Jupiter. But in
the midst of the sacrifice the madness
planned by Juno begins to come upon
him. His sight is darkened, and his
reason changed to delirium. Now
he catches sight of his children, cowering
in fright; he thinks they are the children
of Lycus, immediately lets fly an
arrow at one of them, and seizes a second,
whom he drags from the scene.
Amphitryon, standing where he can see
all that takes place, describes the
wretched death of the second, and then
the third, though Megara tries to save
her last remaining child. She also falls
before the blow of her husband, who
thinks in his madness that she is his
cruel stepmother, Juno. Hercules,
re-entering, exults in his supposed
victory over his enemies, and then
sinks down in a deep faint.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;All is now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
joy and exultation. Fear has departed,
hope has come back again, and
faith in the protecting care of the gods
is restored. Therefore, let all Thebes
give herself up to the rapture and
triumph of this hour.</p>

<p>But now two specters are seen
hovering over the palace, one of whom
introduces herself to the chorus as
Iris, the ambassadress of Juno, and
announces that her companion is a
fiend, daughter of the night. Their
mission hither is, at the command of
Juno, to drive Hercules into a madness
in which he shall slay his children.
The fiend, indeed, makes a weak
protest against such a mission, but
speedily yields and goes darting into
the palace, where we know that she
begins at once her deadly work within
the breast of Hercules.</p>

<p>The chorus bemoans the city's
short-lived joy, and the new and
terrible disaster that has fallen upon
their hero's house. Soon they hear
the mad shouts of Hercules, and know
by these that the fiend has already
done her fatal work.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
calls upon heaven, earth, and sea to
mourn for Hercules in this new disaster
that has befallen him. They pray
that he may be restored to sanity. In
a long apostrophe to Sleep they pray
that the soothing influences of this god
may hold and subdue him until his
former mind returns to its accustomed
course. They watch his feverish
tossings, and suffer with him in the
grief which he so soon must realize.
They close with a pathetic lament over
the dead children.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;A messenger hurries out
of the palace, and describes the dreadful
scenes that have just been enacted
there. Hercules was offering sacrifices
of purification before Jove's altar,
with his three sons and Megara beside
him. All was propitious, when suddenly
a madness seized on Hercules.
He ceased his present sacrifice, declaring
that he must first go to Mycenae
and kill Eurystheus and his
sons, and so make an end of all
his enemies at once. In fancy he
mounted a chariot and speedily arrived
at Mycenae. His own sons seemed
to his disordered vision to be Eurystheus'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
sons; and, rushing savagely
upon them, he soon had slain them
all, and Megara herself. Then did
he fall into a deep, swoonlike slumber,
prostrate beside a mighty column, to
which the attendants tied him securely
with cords, lest he awake and do
further mischief.</p>

<p>The palace doors are now thrown
open, and the prostrate, sleeping
Hercules is seen. Amphitryon warns
the chorus not to wake him lest they
restore him to his miseries. Soon
Hercules awakes, and in his right
mind. He seems to himself to have
had a dreadful dream. He looks in
wonder at the cords which bind his
arms, at the fresh-slain corpses lying
near, at his own arrows scattered on
the floor. He calls aloud for someone
to explain these things to him.
Amphitryon advances and informs
him that in his madness, sent by
Juno's hate, he has destroyed his wife
and all his sons.</p>

<p>And now Theseus, having heard
that Lycus has usurped the throne
of Thebes, and grateful for his own
deliverance from the world of shades
by Hercules, has come with an army
of Athenian youth to aid his friend.
He is shocked to find the hero sitting
in deepest dejection, with head bowed
low, and covered with a mourning-veil.
Quickly he inquires and learns
the truth from Amphitryon. With
noble and unselfish friendship, he offers
his sympathy and help to Hercules,
although the latter warns him to avoid
the contagion which his own guilty
presence engenders. He bids Hercules
be a man, and give over his
threats of self-destruction.</p>

<p>Hercules gives the reasons why it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
is impossible for him to live. First,
Juno's inveterate hate, which attacked
him in his very cradle, pursues him
still, relentlessly; but, most and worst
of all, he has incurred such odium
because of the murder of his wife and
children, that he will be henceforth an
outcast on the earth. No land will
give him refuge now. Why should
he live? Let him die; and let Juno's
cup of happiness be full.</p>

<p>Theseus reminds him that no man
escapes unscathed by fate. Nay, even
the gods themselves have done unlawful
things, and yet live on and do not
feel the obloquy their deeds should
cause. As for a place of refuge,
Athens shall be his home. There
shall he obtain full cleansing for his
crimes, a place of honor, and ample
provision for his wants. All that a
generous and grateful friend can give
shall be his own.</p>

<p>Hercules accepts this offer of Theseus,
reflecting also that he might be
charged with cowardice should he
give up to his troubles and seek refuge
in death. He accordingly takes a
mournful farewell of his dead wife and
children, commends their bodies to
Amphitryon for burial, which it is not
lawful for him to give, and so commits
himself to the hands of his faithful
friend:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">I will follow Theseus,</div>
<div class="i0">Towed like a battered skiff. Whoe'er prefers</div>
<div class="i0">Wealth or dominion to a steadfast friend</div>
<div class="i2">Judges amiss.</div>
</div></div></div>
</div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;Hercules wakes up in his
right mind, bewildered and uncertain
where he is. His eyes fall on the
murdered children, though he does not
as yet recognize them as his own.
He misses his familiar club and bow,
and wonders who has been bold
enough to remove these and not to fear
even a sleeping Hercules. Now he
recognizes in the corpses his own wife
and children:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Oh, what sight is this?</div>
<div class="i0">My sons lie murdered, weltering in their blood;</div>
<div class="i0">My wife is slain. What Lycus rules the land?</div>
<div class="i0">Who could have dared to do such things in Thebes,</div>
<div class="i0">And Hercules returned?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He notices that Theseus and Amphitryon
turn away and will not meet
his gaze. He asks them who has
slain his family. At last, partly through
their half-admissions, and partly
through his own surmise, it comes to
him that this dreadful deed is his own.
His soul reels with the shock, and he
prays wildly for death. No attempts
of his two friends to palliate his deed
can soothe his grief and shame. At
last the threat of old Amphitryon
instantly to anticipate the death of
Hercules by his own leads the hero to
give over his deadly purpose.</p>

<p>He consents to live&mdash;but where?
What land will receive a polluted
wretch like him? He appeals to
Theseus:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O Theseus, faithful friend, seek out a place,</div>
<div class="i0">Far off from here where I may hide myself.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Theseus offers his own Athens as a
place of refuge, where his friend may
find at once asylum and cleansing
from his sin:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">My land awaits thy coming; there will Mars</div>
<div class="i0">Wash clean thy hands and give thee back thy arms.</div>
<div class="i0">That land, O Hercules, now calls to thee,</div>
<div class="i0">Which even gods from sin is wont to free.</div>

<h3>THE <i>HIPPOLYTUS</i> OF EURIPIDES, AND THE <i>HIPPOLYTUS</i> OF
SENECA</h3>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Venus complains that
Hippolytus alone of all men sets her
power at naught and owns allegiance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
to her rival, Diana. She announces
her plan of revenge: that Phaedra
shall become enamored of her stepson,
that Theseus shall be made aware of
this and in his rage be led to slay his
son. If Phaedra perish too, it will
but add to the triumph of the goddess'
slighted power.</p>

<p>Hippolytus comes in from the chase
and renders marked homage to Diana.
He is warned by an aged officer of the
palace "to loathe that pride which
studies not to please." Inquiring the
meaning of this warning, he is told to
recognize the presence of Venus, too,
and to include her in his devotions;
but from this advice he turns away in
scorn.</p>
</div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Hippolytus, in hunting-costume,
appears in the court of the
palace, which is filled with huntsmen
bearing nets and all sorts of hunting-weapons,
and leading dogs in leash.
The young prince, in a long, rambling
speech, assigns places for the hunt, and
their duties to his various servants and
companions. He ends with an elaborate
ascription of praise to his patroness
Diana, as goddess of the chase, and
with a prayer to her for success in his
own present undertaking. The whole
speech is in lyric strain, the anapestic
measure, most commonly employed
by Seneca.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
of Troezenian women deplores the
strange malady that has befallen the
young queen. They relate how</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">This is the third revolving day,</div>
<div class="i2">Since, o'erpowered by lingering pains,</div>
<div class="i2">She from all nourishment abstains,</div>
<div class="i0">Wasting that lovely frame with slow decay.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the conclusion of the lyric part of
the chorus, the queen, closely veiled, in
company with her aged nurse, is seen
coming from the palace gates.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The technical
chorus entry is entirely lacking in
this play. While the chorus may be assumed
to have entered and to have been
present during the long interview between
Phaedra and her nurse, which
forms the first episode, still its presence
is in no way manifested until the end
of this interview.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Full of anxiety, the
nurse strives to indulge her mistress'
every whim. Phaedra answers feebly
at first, but suddenly, to the amazement
of her companion, her speech is
filled with language of the chase, and
she again relapses into her mute lethargy.
At last, under the insistence of the
nurse to probe her mystery, Phaedra
confesses that the wretched fate of her
house pursues her, too, and that she
now feels the torments of love; and,
though she does not speak his name,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
the truth at last is clear that Hippolytus
is the object of her passion. The
nurse recoils in horror and shame from
this confession.</p>

<p>Phaedra describes how she has
struggled against her unhappy love,
but in vain, and is now resolved on
death in order to save her honor. At
this the nurse throws all her influence
in the opposite scale, arguing that, after
all, the sway of Venus is universal,
that it is only human to love, and that
this is no reason why one should cast
his life away. She even proposes to
acquaint Hippolytus with her mistress'
feelings, and strive to win his love in
return. This proposal Phaedra indignantly
rejects. The nurse then
offers to fetch from the house certain
philters which will cure the queen of
her malady. The queen reluctantly
consents to this, and the nurse retires
into the palace.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Phaedra bewails her
present lot, in that she has been forced
to leave her native Crete, and live in
wedlock with her father's enemy. And
even he has now deserted her, gone to
the very realms of Dis, in company
with a madcap friend, to seduce and
bear away the gloomy monarch's
queen. But a worse grief than this is
preying on her soul. She feels in her
own heart the devastating power of
unlawful love, which has already
destroyed all the natural interests of
her life. She recalls her mother's
unhappy passion; but this was bearable
compared with her own. For
Venus has, from deadly hatred of her
family, filled her with a far more hopeless
love. She does not name the
object of her passion, but, from her
guarded references, it is clear that
Hippolytus, her stepson, is meant.</p>

<p>The nurse urges her mistress to drive
this passion from her breast, moralizing
upon the danger of delay. Has
not her house already known sinful
love enough? Such love is dangerous
for it cannot long be hid. Granting
that Theseus may never return to
earth, can her sin be concealed from
her father? from her grandsires, both
gods of heaven? And what of her own
conscience? Can she ever be happy
or at peace with such a sin upon her
soul? She pictures her mistress'
passion in all its hideousness. Besides,
it is most hopeless, since Hippolytus,
woman-hater that he is, can
never be brought to respond to it.
Phaedra yields to these arguments and
entreaties of the nurse, and says that
now she is resolved upon death as her
only refuge. Hereupon the nurse
(the usual rôle) begs her not to take
this desperate course, and undertakes
to bend Hippolytus to their will.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
prays that love may never come upon
its breast with immoderate power, and
relates instances of the resistless sway
of Venus and her son.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
sings at length upon the universal and
irresistible sway of love.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Phaedra, standing
near the doors of the palace, suddenly
becomes agitated, and utters despairing
cries. The chorus, inquiring the
cause of these, is told to listen. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
first there is only a confused murmur
from within; but this soon resolves
itself into the angry denunciations of
Hippolytus and the pleading tones of
the nurse. By these Phaedra learns
that the nurse has indeed revealed the
fatal secret to Hippolytus under an
oath that he will not betray the truth
to anyone, and that the youth has
received the announcement with horror
and scorn. He breaks forth into bitter
reproaches against all womankind.
He regrets that his lips are sealed by
his oath, else would he straightway
reveal to Theseus all his wife's unfaithfulness.</p>

<p>Phaedra, on her side, reproaches the
nurse for betraying her secret. She
angrily dismisses her, and, after exacting
an oath of silence from the chorus,
goes out, reiterating her resolve to die,
and suggests that she has one expedient
left by which her name may be preserved
from infamy, and her sons from
dishonor.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;On the inquiry of
the chorus as to how the queen is faring,
the nurse describes the dreadful effect
which this malady of love has already
produced upon her. Then the palace
doors open, and Phaedra is seen
reclining upon a couch, attended by
her tiring-women. She rejects all the
beautiful robes and jewels which they
offer, and desires to be dressed as a
huntress, ready for the chase.</p>

<p>The nurse prays to Diana to conquer
the stubborn soul of Hippolytus and
bend his heart toward her mistress.
At this moment the youth himself
enters and inquires the cause of the
nurse's distress.</p>

<p>Thereupon ensues a long debate, in
which the nurse chides Hippolytus for
his austere life and argues that the
pleasures of life were meant to be
enjoyed, and that no life comes to its
full fruition unless youth is given free
rein. The young man replies by a
rhapsody on the life of the woods, so
full of simple, wholesome joys, and so
free from all the cares of life at court
and among men. He compares this
with the Golden Age, and traces the
gradual fall from the innocence of
that time to the abandoned sin of the
present. He concludes with laying all
the blame for this upon woman.</p>

<p>Phaedra now comes forth, and,
seeing Hippolytus, falls fainting, but is
caught in the young man's arms. He
attempts to reassure her and inquires
the cause of her evident grief. After
much hesitation, she at last confesses
her love for him and begs him to pity
her. With scorn and horror he repulses
her and starts to kill her with
his sword; but, deciding not so to
stain his sword, he throws the weapon
away and makes off toward the forest.</p>

<p>The nurse now plans to save her
mistress by inculpating Hippolytus.
She accordingly calls loudly for help,
and tells the attendants who come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
rushing in that the youth has attempted
an assault upon the queen, and
shows his sword in evidence.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
prays to be wafted far away from these
scenes of woe; and laments that the
hapless queen had ever come from
Crete, for then she would not now be
doomed by hopeless love to self-inflicted
death.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
dwells upon and praises the beauty of
Hippolytus, and discourses upon the
theme that beauty has always been a
dangerous possession, citing various
mythological instances in proof of this.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;A messenger hurriedly
enters with the announcement
that the queen has destroyed herself by
the noose. The chorus, though grieved,
manifests no surprise at this, and is
divided as to a plan of action. And
now enters Theseus, who demands
the cause of the lamentations of the
servants, which may be heard from
within the palace. He learns from
the chorus the fact and manner, but
not the cause, of Phaedra's death.</p>

<p>The palace doors are now thrown
open and the shrouded body of the
queen is discovered within. Theseus,
in an agony of lamentations, seeks to
know the cause of his queen's death.
He at length discovers a letter clasped
in her dead hand, by which he is informed
that Phaedra has slain herself
in grief and shame because her honor
has been violated by the king's own
son, Hippolytus. Thereupon Theseus
curses his son, and calls on Neptune
to destroy him, offering this as one of
the three requests which, in accordance
with the promise of the god, should not
be denied.</p>

<p>Here enters Hippolytus, hearing the
sound of his father's voice. He looks
in amazement upon the corpse of
Phaedra, and begs his father to explain
her death. Theseus, supposing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
his son conceals a guilty conscience,
makes no direct answer, but inveighs
against the specious arts of man. This
strange speech, and still more the
manner of his father, now show Hippolytus
that he himself is connected in
his father's mind with Phaedra's
death; and he seeks to know who has
thus calumniated him. The wrath
of Theseus now breaks over all bounds.
He charges his son with the dishonor
and murder of his wife, and with
withering scorn taunts him with his
former professions of purity. Hippolytus
protests his innocence, but
Theseus continues obdurate, and produces
the fatal letter in proof of his
statements. Then the youth realizes
the terrible mesh of circumstances in
which he is taken; but, bound by his
oath of secrecy, he endures in silence.
After Theseus has pronounced the
doom of exile upon him, and retired
within the gates, he himself goes forth
to seek his comrades and acquaint
them with his fate.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">

<p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Theseus, just returned
to earth from hades, and with
all the horrors of the lower world still
upon him, briefly refers to his dreadful
experiences and his escape by the aid
of Hercules. Then, hearing the
sounds of lamentation, he asks the
cause. He is told by the nurse that
Phaedra, for some reason which she
will not disclose, has resolved on
immediate self-destruction. Rushing
into the palace, he encounters Phaedra
just within. After urgent entreaties
and threats from Theseus, she confesses
that she is determined to die in
order to remove the stain upon her
honor; and without mentioning the
name of him who has ruined her, she
shows the sword which Hippolytus
has left behind in his flight. This is
at once recognized by Theseus, who
flies into a wild passion of horror, rage,
and bitter scorn. He vows dire vengeance
upon his son, which shall reach
him wherever he may flee; and ends
by claiming from Neptune, as the
third of the boons once granted him,
that the god will destroy Hippolytus.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
reflects upon the precarious life of man,
lauds the golden mean, and prays for
the blessings of life without conspicuous
fame. No man can hope for continued
security in life, when such a
youth as Hippolytus is driven off by
Theseus' ire. It laments that no
longer will his steeds, his lyre, his
wonted woodland haunts know the
well-loved youth; and reproaches the
gods that they did not better screen
their guiltless votary.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
complains that while nature is so careful
to maintain the order of the heavenly
bodies, the atmospheric phenomena,
the seasons, and the productiveness of
wealth, for the affairs of men alone
she has no care. These go all awry.
Sin prospers and righteousness is in
distress. Verily, it does not at all
profit a man to strive to live uprightly,
since all the rewards of life go to the
vain and profligate. While the case
of Hippolytus is not mentioned, it is
clearly in mind throughout.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;The last words of the chorus
are interrupted by the approach of
a messenger who hastily inquires for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
the king. As the latter comes forth
from the palace, the messenger announces
the death of his son. At the
king's request he gives a detailed account
of the disaster: how Hippolytus
was driving his fiery coursers along the
shore, when Neptune sent a monstrous
bull from out the sea, which drove the
horses to a panic of fear; how the car
was at length dashed against a ragged
cliff, and Hippolytus dragged, bruised
and bleeding, by the maddened horses;
how, though yet living, he could not
long survive. Theseus expresses pleasure
at his son's sufferings, and bids
that he be brought into his presence
that he may behold his punishment.</p>

<p>The chorus interjects a single
strophe, acknowledging Venus as the
unrivaled queen of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>Diana now appears to Theseus and
reveals to him the whole truth, explaining
the infatuation of the queen,
the fatal letter, and the wiles of Venus.
The father is filled with horror and
remorse. Diana tells him that he may
yet hope for pardon for his sin, since
through the wiles of Venus, which she
herself could not frustrate, the deed
was done.</p>

<p>Here the dying Hippolytus is borne
in by his friends. In his agony he
prays for death; but by the voice of
his loved goddess he is soothed and
comforted. After a touching scene
of reconciliation between the dying
prince and his father, the youth
perishes, leaving Theseus overcome
with grief.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;A messenger, hurrying in,
announces to Theseus the death of his
son. Theseus receives the news
calmly and asks for a detailed account.
The messenger relates how Hippolytus
had yoked his horses to his car and
was driving madly along the highway
by the sea, when suddenly the waves
swelled up and launched a strange
monster in the form of a bull upon the
land. This monster charged upon
Hippolytus, who fronted the beast with
unshaken courage. But in the end
the horses became unmanageable
through fright, and dragged their
master to his death among the rocks.
The body of the hapless Hippolytus
has been torn in pieces and scattered
far and wide through the fields; and
even now attendants are bringing
these in for burning on the pyre.
Theseus laments, not because his son
is dead, but because it is through his,
the father's, act.</p>

<p>The chorus expatiates upon the
fact that the blows of fate fall heavily
upon men of exalted condition, but
spare the humble. The great Theseus,
once so mighty a monarch, but
now so full of woe, is an example of
this truth. It has not profited him
to escape from hades, since now his
son has hastened thither.</p>

<p>But now their attention is turned to
Phaedra who appears, wailing aloud,
and with a drawn sword in hand.
She rails at Theseus as the destroyer
of his house, weeps over the mangled
remains of Hippolytus, confesses to
Theseus that her charge against his
son was false, and ends by falling upon
the sword.</p>

<p>Theseus, utterly crushed by the
weight of woe that has fallen upon
him, prays only that he may return to
the dark world from which he has
just escaped.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
The chorus reminds him that he will
find ample time for mourning, and
that he should now pay due funeral
honors to his son. Whereat Theseus
bids all the fragments be hunted out
and brought before him. These he
fits together as best he can, lamenting
bitterly as each new gory part is
brought to him.</p>

<p>He ends by giving curt command for
the burial of Phaedra, with a prayer
that the earth may rest heavily upon
her.</p></div>

<h3><i>THE MAIDENS OF TRACHIN</i> OF SOPHOCLES, AND THE <i>HERCULES
OETAEUS</i> OF SENECA</h3>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;In the courtyard of her
palace in Trachin, Deianira recounts
to her attendants and the chorus of
Trachinian maidens how her husband
had won her from the river god,
Acheloüs, and how, during all these
years, she has lived in fear and longing
for her husband, who has been
kept constantly wandering over the
earth by those who hold him in their
power; and even now he has been for
many months absent, she knows not
where.</p>

<p>An old servant proposes that she
send her son, Hyllus, abroad to seek
out his father. This the youth, who
enters at this juncture, readily promises
to do, especially on hearing from
his mother that the oracle declares this
is the year in which his father shall
end his life,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Or, having this his task accomplished,</div>
<div class="i0">Shall, through the coming years of all his life,</div>
<div class="i0">Rejoice and prosper.</div>
</div></div></div></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Hercules, about to sacrifice
to Cenaean Jove after having
conquered Eurytus, king of Oechalia,
recounts at length his mighty toils on
earth, and prays that now at last he
may be given his proper place in
heaven. He dispatches his herald,
Lichas, home to Trachin, to tell the
news of his triumph, and to conduct
the train of captives thither.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
prays to Helios, the bright sun-god,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
for tidings of Hercules, for Deianira
longs for him, and "ever nurses unforgetting
dread as to her husband's
paths." Hercules is tossed upon the
stormy sea of life, now up, now down,
but ever kept from death by some god's
hands. Deianira should, therefore,
be comforted:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">For who hath known in Zeus forgetfulness</div>
<div class="i0">Of those he children calls?</div>
</div></div></div></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The place
of the chorus entry, which should be
filled by the chorus proper, composed
of Aetolian maidens, is taken by the
band of captive Oechalian maidens.
They bewail their lot and long for
death; they dwell upon the utter
desolation of their fatherland, and
upon the hard-heartedness of Hercules
who has laid it waste.</p>

<p>Iole, their princess, joins in their
lamentations, recalls the horrors of
her native city's overthrow, and
looks forward with dread to her captivity.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Deianira confides to
the chorus her special cause for grief:
she feels a strong presentiment that
Hercules is dead; for, when he last
left home, he left a tablet, as it were
a will, disposing of his chattels and
his lands,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">and fixed a time,</div>
<div class="i0">That when for one whole year and three months more</div>
<div class="i0">He from his land was absent, then 'twas his</div>
<div class="i0">Or in that self-same hour to die, or else,</div>
<div class="i0">Escaping that one crisis, thenceforth live with life unvexed.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>At this moment, however, a messenger
enters and announces the near
approach of Hercules accompanied by
his spoils of victory.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;During the interval
just preceding this episode, the captives
have been led to Trachin, Deianira
has seen the beauty of Iole, and
learned of Hercules' infatuation for
her. She has by this news been
thrown into a mad rage of jealousy,
and counsels with her nurse as to how
she may take vengeance upon her
faithless husband, while the nurse
vainly advises moderation.</p>

<p>The nurse at last suggests recourse
to magic, professing herself to be proficient
in these arts. This suggests to
Deianira the use of that blood of Nessus
which the dying centaur had commended
to her as an infallible love-charm.
She takes occasion to relate
at length the Nessus incident. She
at once acts upon her decision to use
the charm; and speedily, with the
nurse's aid, a gorgeous robe is anointed
with the blood, and this is sent by
Lichas' hand to Hercules.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
voices its exultant joy over this glad
and unexpected news.</p></div>
<div class="comparison">
<p>
<i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
of Aetolian women, who have followed
Deianira from her girlhood's home to
this refuge in Trachin, now tender
to her their sympathy in her present
sufferings. They recall all their past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
intercourse with her, and assure her
of their undying fidelity.</p>

<p>This suggests the rarity of such
fidelity especially in the courts of
kings, and they discourse at large upon
the sordidness and selfishness of courtiers
in general. The moral of their
discourse is that men should not
aspire to great wealth and power, but
should choose a middle course in
life, which only can bring happiness.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Lichas, the personal
herald of Hercules, now enters,
followed by Iole and a company of
captive women. He explains to
Deianira how Hercules had been
driven on by petty persecutions to
slay Iphitus, the son of Eurytus,
treacherously; how he had for this
been doomed by Zeus to serve Omphale,
queen of Lydia, for a year; and
how in revenge he has now slain
Eurytus, and even now is sending
home these Oechalian captives as
spoil; Hercules himself is delaying
yet a little while in Euboea, until he
has sacrificed to Cenaean Jove.</p>

<p>Deianira looks in pity upon the
captives praying that their lot may
never come to her or hers; and is
especially drawn in sympathy to one
beautiful girl, who, however, will
answer no word as to her name and
state.</p>

<p>As all are passing into the palace,
the messenger detains Deianira and
tells her the real truth which Lichas
has withheld: that this seemingly
unknown girl is Iole, daughter of
Eurytus; that it was not in revenge
but for love of Iole that Hercules
destroyed her father's house, and
that he is now sending her to his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
home not as his slave, but mistress,
and rival of his wife.</p>

<p>Lichas, returning from the palace,
on being challenged by the messenger
and urged by Deianira to speak the
whole truth, tells all concerning Hercules'
love for Iole.</p>

<p>Deianira receives this revelation
with seeming equanimity and acquiescence.</p>
</div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Deianira comes
hurrying distractedly out of the palace,
and relates her discovery as to the
horrible and deadly power of the
charm which she has sent to her
husband.</p>

<p>While she is still speaking, Hyllus
rushes in and cries out to his mother
to flee from the wrath of Hercules,
whose dreadful sufferings, after putting
on the robe which his wife had
sent to him, the youth describes at
length. He narrates also the death
of Lichas. The suffering hero is even
now on his way by sea from Euboea,
in a death-like swoon, and will soon
arrive at Trachin.</p>

<p>Deianira, smitten with quick repentance,
begs Jupiter to destroy her with
his wrathful thunderbolts. She resolves
on instant self-destruction,
though Hyllus and the nurse vainly
try to dissuade her, and to belittle her
responsibility for the disaster; and in
the end she rushes from the scene,
Hyllus following.</p>
</div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
briefly reverts to the battle of Acheloüs
and Hercules for the hand of
Deianira.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus,
contemplating the changing fates
of their prince's house, is reminded of
the saying of Orpheus, "that naught
for endless life is made." This leads
to an extended description of Orpheus'
sweet music and its power over all
things, both animate and inanimate,
and suggests the story of his unsuccessful
attempt to regain Eurydice.</p>

<p>Returning to the original theme, the
chorus speculates upon the time when
all things shall fall into death, and chaos
resume her primeval sway.</p>

<p>It is startled out of these thoughts
by loud groans, which prove to be the
outcries of Hercules, borne home to
Trachin.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Deianira tells to the
chorus the story of how Nessus, the
centaur, had once insulted her, and
for this had been slain by Hercules
with one of his poisoned arrows; how,
also, the centaur in dying had given
her a portion of his blood, saying this
would be a charm able to restore to
her her husband's wandering love.
She now resolves to use this charm.
She anoints a gorgeous robe with the
blood which she has preserved through
all these years, and bids Lichas carry
this to her lord as a special gift from
her. He is to wear it as he offers his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
sacrifices to Cenaean Jove, Lichas
departs upon this mission.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p>
<i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Hercules in his
ravings warns Jove to look well to his
heavens, since now their defender is
perishing. The giants will be sure
to rise again and make another attempt
upon the skies. He bitterly laments
that he, who has overcome so many
monsters, must die at last, slain by a
woman's hand, and that woman not
Juno, nor even an Amazon:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Ah, woe is me,</div>
<div class="i0">How often have I 'scaped a glorious death!</div>
<div class="i0">What honor comes from such an end as this?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>His burning pains coming on again,
he cries out in agony, and describes
the abject misery and weakness that
have come upon him. Are these the
shoulders, the hands, the feet, that
were once so strong to bear, so terrible
to strike, so swift to go? He strives
to apprehend and tear away the pest
that is devouring him, but it is too
deep-hidden in his frame. He curses
the day that has seen him weep and
beseeches Jove to smite him dead with
a thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Alcmena enters, and, while she
herself is full of grief, she strives to
soothe and comfort her suffering son.
He falls into a delirium, and thinks
that he is in the heavens, looking
down upon Trachin. But soon he
awakes, and, realizing his pains once
more, calls for the author of his misery,
that he may slay her with his own
hands.</p>

<p>Hyllus, who has just entered from
the palace, now informs his father that
Deianira is already dead, and by her
own hand; that it was not her fault,
moreover, but by the guile of Nessus,
that Hercules is being done to death.
The hero recognizes in this the fulfilment
of an oracle once delivered to
him:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">By the hand of one whom thou hast slain, some day,</div>
<div class="i0">Victorious Hercules, shalt thou lie low.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And he comforts himself with the
reflection that such an end as this is
meet, for</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thus shall no conqueror of Hercules</div>
<div class="i0">Survive to tell the tale.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He now bids Philoctetes prepare a
mighty pyre on neighboring Mount
Oeta, and there take and burn his body,
still in life. Hyllus he bids to take the
captive princess, Iole, to wife. He
calls upon his mother, Alcmena, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
comfort her grief by pride in her great
son's deeds on earth, and the noble
fame which he has gained thereby.</p>
</div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
prays for the early and safe return of
Hercules from where he lingers:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Thence may lie come, yea, come with strong desire,</div>
<div class="i4">Tempered by suasive spell</div>
<div class="i0">Of that rich unguent, as the monster spake.</div>
</div></div></div></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
bids all nature mourn the death of
Hercules. Verily the earth is bereft of
her defender, and there is no one left to
whom she may turn if again harassed
by monsters. They speculate upon
the place of the departed Hercules.
Shall he sit in judgment among the
pious kings of Crete in hades, or shall
he be given a place in heaven? At
least on earth he shall live in deathless
gratitude and fame.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Fourth episode.</i>&mdash;Deianira discovers
by experiment, now that it is too late,
the destructive and terrible power of
the charm which she has sent, and is
filled with dire forebodings as to the
result.</p>

<p>Her lamentations are interrupted by
Hyllus, who comes hurrying in; he
charges his mother with the murder of
his father, and curses her. He then
describes the terrible sufferings that
have come upon the hero through the
magic robe, and how Hercules, in the
madness of pain, has slain Lichas, as
the immediate cause of his sufferings.
He has brought his father with him
from Euboea to Trachin. Deianira
withdraws into the palace, without a
word, in an agony of grief.</p>

<p><i>Fourth choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
recalls the old oracle that after
twelve years the son of Zeus should
gain rest from toil, and sees in his
impending death the fulfilment of
this oracle. They picture the grief of
Deianira over her act, and foresee the
great changes that are coming upon
their prince's house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
<i>Fifth episode.</i>&mdash;The nurse rushes in
from the palace, and tells how Deianira
has slain herself with the sword, bewailing
the while the sufferings which
she has unwittingly brought on Hercules;
and how Hyllus repents him of
his harshness toward his mother,
realizing that she was not to blame.</p>

<p><i>Fifth choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
pours out its grief for the double
tragedy. And now it sees Hyllus and
attendants bearing in the dying
Hercules.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;Hercules, awaking from
troubled sleep, laments the calamity
that has befallen him; he chides the
lands which he has helped, that now
they do not hasten to his aid; and
prays Hyllus to kill him with the
sword, and so put him out of his
misery.</p>

<p>He denounces Deianira because she
has brought suffering and destruction
upon him which no foe, man or beast,
has ever been able to bring. He curses
his own weakness, and laments that
he must weep and groan like a
woman.</p>

<p>He marvels that his mighty frame,
which for years has withstood so many
monsters, which he recounts at length,
can now be so weak and wasted.
Reverting to his wife, he bids that
she be brought to him that he may
visit punishment upon her.</p>

<p>Hyllus informs his father that Deianira
has died by her own hand, for
grief at what she has unwittingly
brought upon her dear lord. It was,
indeed, through Nessus' guile that the
deed was done.</p>

<p>Hercules, on hearing this, recognizes
the fulfilment of the oracle;</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
Long since it was revealéd of my sire</div>
<div class="i0">That I should die by hand of none that live,</div>
<div class="i0">But one who, dead, had dwelt in hades dark.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He exacts an oath of obedience from
Hyllus, and then bids him bring his
father to Mount Oeta, and there place
him upon a pyre for burning. Hyllus
reluctantly consents in all but the
actual firing of the pyre. The next
request is concerning Iole, that Hyllus
should take her as his wife. This
mandate he indignantly refuses to
obey, but finally yields assent. And
in the end Hercules is borne away to
his burning, while the chorus mournfully
chants its concluding comment:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What cometh no man may know;</div>
<div class="i4">What is, is piteous for us,</div>
<div class="i4">Base and shameful for them;</div>
<div class="i0">And for him who endureth this woe,</div>
<div class="i4">Above all that live hard to bear.</div>
</div></div></div>
</div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;Philoctetes enters, and, in
response to the questions of the nurse,
describes the final scene on Oeta's top.
There a mighty pyre is built, on
which Hercules joyfully takes his
place. There he reclines, gazing at
the heavens, and praying his father,
Jupiter, to take him thither, in compensation
for his service on the earth.
His prayer seems to be answered, and
he cries aloud:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"But lo, my father calls me from the sky,</div>
<div class="i0">And opens wide the gates. O sire, I come!"</div>
<div class="i0">And as he spake his face was glorified.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He presents his famous bow and
arrows to Philoctetes, bidding him
for this prize apply the torch and light
the pyre, which his friend most reluctantly
does. The hero courts the
flames, and eagerly presses into the
very heart of the burning mass.</p>

<p>In the midst of this narrative, Alcmena
enters, bearing in her bosom an
urn containing the ashes of Hercules.
The burden of her lament is that so
small a compass and so pitiful estate
have come to the mighty body of her
son, which one small urn can hold.
But when she thinks upon his deeds,
her thoughts fly to the opposite pole:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">What sepulcher, O son, what tomb for thee</div>
<div class="i0">Is great enough? Naught save the world itself.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then she takes up in quickened
measures her funeral song of mourning
in the midst of which the deified
Hercules, taking shape in the air above,
speaks to his mother, bidding her no
longer mourn, for he has at last gained
his place in heaven.</p>

<p>The chorus strikes a fitting final
note, that the truly brave are not
destined to the world below:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But when life's days are all consumed,</div>
<div class="i0">And comes the final hour, for them</div>

<h3>THE <i>TROADES</i> OF EURIPIDES, AND THE <i>TROADES</i> OF SENECA</h3>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Neptune appearing from
the depths of the sea, briefly recounts
the story of the overthrow of Troy,
which he laments, states the present
situation of the Trojan women, dwells
upon the especial grief of Hecuba,
and places the blame for all this ruin
upon Minerva:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But, oh my town, once flourishing, once crowned</div>
<div class="i0">With beauteous-structured battlements, farewell!</div>
<div class="i0">Had not Minerva sunk thee in the dust,</div>
<div class="i0">On thy firm base e'en now thou mightst have stood.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>To him appears Minerva, who,
though she had indeed helped the
Greeks to their final triumph over
Troy, had been turned against them
by the outrage of Cassandra on the
night of Troy's overthrow. She now
makes common cause with Neptune,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
and plans for the harassing of the
Greek fleet by storm and flood on the
homeward voyage. The Greeks are
to be taught a lesson of reverence:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Unwise is he, whoe'er of mortals storms</div>
<div class="i0">Beleaguered towns, and crushed in ruins wastes</div>

<div class="i0">Where sleep the dead; for he shall perish soon.</div>
</div></div>

<p class="center">[The two gods disappear.]</p></div>

<p>Hecuba, lying prone upon the
ground before Agamemnon's tent,
gives voice to her sufferings of body
and of spirit; laments her accumulated
losses of home, friends, station,
liberty; blames Helen for all, and
calls upon the chorus of captive
women to join her in lamentation.</p>
</div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;Hecuba bewails the fall
of Troy, and draws from it a warning
to all who are high in power:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">For of a truth did fortune never show</div>
<div class="i0">In plainer wise the frailty of the prop</div>
<div class="i0">That doth support a king.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She graphically describes the mighty
power and mighty fall of her husband's
kingdom, and portrays the awe with
which the Greeks behold even their
fallen foe. She asserts that the fire by
which her city has been consumed
sprang from her, the brand that she
had dreamed of in her dream before
the birth of Paris. She dwells horribly
upon the death of Priam which
she had herself witnessed.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">But still the heavenly powers are not appeased.</div>

<p>Hecuba next calls upon the chorus
of Trojan women to join her in lamenting
their fallen heroes, Hector and
Priam.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus
with Hecuba indulges in speculation
as to the place of their future home,
speaking with hope of some Greek
lands, and deprecating others.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Parode, or chorus entry.</i>&mdash;The chorus,
under the direction of Hecuba as
chorus leader, in true oriental fashion,
bewails the downfall of Troy, and in

Hector.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Talthybius, the herald,
enters and announces that the
lots have been drawn, and reveals to
each captive her destined lord: that
Cassandra has fallen to Agamemnon,
Andromache to Pyrrhus, Hecuba to
Ulysses. At news of this her fate,
Hecuba is filled with fresh lamentations,
counting it an especial hardship
that she should fall to the arch-enemy
of her race. The herald also darkly
alludes to the already accomplished
fate of Polyxena,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">At the tomb raised to Achilles doomed to serve.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hecuba does not as yet catch the
import of these words.</p>

<p>Cassandra now enters, waving a
torch, and celebrates in a mad refrain
her approaching union with Agamemnon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
Hecuba remonstrates with her
for her unseemly joy; whereupon
Cassandra declares that she rejoices
in the prospect of the vengeance upon
Agamemnon which is to be wrought
out through this union. She contrasts
the lot of the Greeks and Trojans during
the past ten years, and finds that
the latter have been far happier; and
even in her fall, the woes of Troy are
far less than those that await the
Greek chieftains. She then prophesies
in detail the trials that await Ulysses,
and the dire result of her union with
Agamemnon:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Thou shalt bear me</div>
<div class="i0">A fury, an Erinys from this land.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hecuba here falls in a faint, and,
upon being revived, again recounts
her former high estate, sadly contrasts
with that her present condition, and
shudders at the lot of the slave which
awaits her:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">Then deem not of the great</div>
<div class="i0">Now flourishing as happy, ere they die.</div>
</div></div></div></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>First episode.</i>&mdash;Talthybius announces
that the shade of Achilles has appeared
with the demand that Polyxena
be sacrificed upon the hero's tomb.</p>

<p>Enter Pyrrhus and Agamemnon,
the former demanding that his father's
request be carried out, the latter resisting
the demand as too barbarous to be
entertained. It is finally agreed to
leave the decision to Calchas. He is
accordingly summoned, and at once
declares that only by the death of the
maiden can the Greeks be allowed
to set sail for home. And not this
alone, but Astyanax also must be
sacrificed&mdash;hurled from the lofty
Scaean tower of Troy.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
graphically describes the wooden
horse, its joyful reception by the Trojans
into the city, their sense of relief
from danger, and their holiday spirit;
and at last their horrible awakening to
death at the hands of the Greeks within
the walls.</p></div>
<div class="comparison">

<p><i>First choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
maintains that all perishes with the
body; the soul goes out into nothingness:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">For when within the tomb we're laid,</div>
<div class="i0">No soul remains, no hov'ring shade.</div>
<div class="i0">Like curling smoke, like clouds before the blast,</div>
<div class="i0">This animating spirit soon has passed.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The evident purpose of these considerations
is to discount the story that
Achilles' shade could have appeared
with its demand for the death of Polyxena.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;The appearance of
Andromache with Astyanax in her
arms, borne captive on a Grecian car,
is a signal for general mourning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
She announces her own chief cause of
woe:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I, with my child, am led away, the spoil</div>
<div class="i0">Of war; th' illustrious progeny of kings,</div>
<div class="i0">Oh, fatal change, is sunk to slavery.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Her next announcement comes as a
still heavier blow to Hecuba:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Polyxena, thy daughter, is no more;</div>
<div class="i0">Devoted to Achilles, on his tomb,</div>
<div class="i0">An offering to the lifeless dead, she fell.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Andromache insists that Polyxena's
fate is happier than her own; argues
that in death there is no sense of
misery:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Polyxena is dead, and of her ills</div>
<div class="i0">Knows nothing;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>while Andromache still lives to feel
the keen contrast between her former
and her present lot.</p>

<p>Hecuba is so sunk in woe that she
can make no protest, but advises
Andromache to forget the past and</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i4">honor thy present lord,</div>
<div class="i0">And with thy gentle manners win his soul;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>this with the hope that she may be
the better able to rear up Astyanax to
establish once more some day the
walls and power of Troy.</p>

<p>But the heaviest stroke is yet to fall.
Talthybius now enters and announces
with much reluctance that Ulysses
has prevailed upon the Greeks to demand
the death of Astyanax for the
very reason that he may grow up to
renew the Trojan war. The lad is to
be hurled from a still standing tower
of Troy. The herald warns Andromache
that if she resist this mandate
she may be endangering the boy's
funeral rites. She yields to fate, passionately
caressing the boy, who clings
fearfully to her, partly realizing his
terrible situation. The emotional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
climax of the play is reached, as she
says to the clinging, frightened lad:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Why dost thou clasp me with thy hands, why hold</div>
<div class="i0">My robes, and shelter thee beneath my wings</div>
<div class="i0">Like a young bird?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She bitterly upbraids the Greeks for
their cruelty, and curses Helen as the
cause of all her woe, and then gives
the boy up in an abandonment of
defiant grief:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Here, take him, bear him, hurl him from the height,</div>
<div class="i0">If ye must hurl him; feast upon his flesh:</div>
<div class="i0">For from the gods hath ruin fall'n on us.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And now what more can happen?
Surely the depth of misfortune has
been sounded. In the voice of Hecuba:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">Is there an ill</div>
<div class="i0">We have not? What is wanting to the woes</div>
<div class="i0">Which all the dreadful band of ruin brings?</div>
</div></div></div>
</div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Second episode.</i>&mdash;Andromache appears
with Astyanax and recounts a
vision of Hector which she has had, in
which her dead husband has warned
her to hide the boy away beyond the
reach of threatening danger. After
discussion with an old man as to the
best place of concealment, she hides
Astyanax in Hector's tomb which is
in the near background.</p>

<p>Enter Ulysses, who reluctantly announces
that Calchas has warned the
Greeks that they must not allow the
son of Hector to grow to manhood;
for if they do so, the reopening of the
Trojan war will be only a matter of
time, and the work will have to be done
all over again. He therefore asks
Andromache to give up the boy to
him. Then ensues a war of wits
between the desperate mother and the
crafty Greek. She affects not to
know where the boy is&mdash;he is lost.
But if she knew, no power on earth
should take him from her. Ulysses
threatens death, which she welcomes;
he threatens torture, which she scorns.
She at last states that her son is
"among the dead." Ulysses, taking
these words at their face meaning,
starts off gladly to tell the news to the
Greeks, but suddenly reflects that he
has no proof but the mother's word.
He therefore begins to watch Andromache
more narrowly, and discovers
that her bearing is not that of one who
has put her grief behind her, but of
one who is still in suspense and fear.
To test her, he suddenly calls to his
attendants to hunt out the boy.
Looking beyond her he cries: "Good!
he's found! bring him to me." Whereat
Andromache's agitation proves
that the boy is indeed not dead but in
hiding. Where is he hid? Ulysses
forces her to choose between the living
boy and the dead husband; for, unless
her son is forthcoming, Hector's
tomb will be invaded and his ashes
scattered upon the sea. To her
frantic prayer for mercy he says:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Bring forth the boy&mdash;and pray.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Follows a <i>canticum</i>, in which Andromache
brings Astyanax out of the
tomb and sets him in Ulysses' sight:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">Here, here's the terror of a thousand ships!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and prays him to spare the child.
Ulysses refuses, and, after allowing the
mother time for a passionate and
pathetic farewell to her son, he leads
the boy away to his death.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
first tells of the former fall of Troy
under Hercules and Telamon; and
then refers to the high honors that had
come to the city through the translation
of Ganymede to be the cupbearer
of Jove, and through the special grace
of Venus. But these have not availed
to save the city from its present destruction.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
discusses the various places to
which it may be its misfortune to be
carried into captivity. It professes
a willingness to go anywhere but to
the homes of Helen, Agamemnon, and
Ulysses.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Menelaüs appears,
announcing that the Greeks have alotted
to him Helen, his former wife,
the cause of all this strife, to do with
as he will. He declares his intention
to take her to Greece, and there destroy
her as a warning to faithless wives.</p>

<p>Hecuba applauds this decision, and
thinks that at last heaven has sent
justice to the earth:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">Dark thy ways</div>
<div class="i0">And silent are thy steps to mortal man;</div>
<div class="i0">Yet thou with justice all things dost ordain.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
Helen, dragged forth from the tent at
the command of Menelaüs, pleads
her cause. She lays the blame for all
upon Hecuba and Priam:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">She first, then, to these ills</div>
<div class="i0">Gave birth, when she gave Paris birth; and next</div>
<div class="i0">The agéd Priam ruined Troy and thee,</div>
<div class="i0">The infant not destroying, at his birth</div>
<div class="i0">Denounced a baleful firebrand.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Blame should also fall upon Venus,
since through her influence Helen
came into the power of Paris.</p>

<p>Hecuba refutes the excuses of Helen.
She scouts the idea that Venus brought
Paris to Sparta. The only Venus that
had influenced Helen was her own
passion inflamed by the beauty of
Paris:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">My son was with surpassing beauty graced;</div>
<div class="i0">And thy fond passion, when he struck thy sight,</div>
<div class="i0">Became a Venus.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>As for the excuse that she was borne
away by force, no Spartan was aware
of that, no cries were heard. Hecuba
ends by urging Menelaüs to carry out
his threat. This, he repeats, it is his
purpose to do.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">

<p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Helen approaches
the Trojan women, saying that she
has been sent by the Greeks to deck
Polyxena for marriage with Pyrrhus,
this being a ruse to trick the girl into
an unresisting preparation for her
death. This news Polyxena, though
mute, receives with horror.</p>

<p>Andromache bitterly cries out upon
Helen and her marriages as the cause
of all their woe. But Helen puts the
whole matter to this test:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">Count this true,</div>
<div class="i0">If 'twas a Spartan vessel brought me here.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Under the pointed questions of Andromache
she gives up deception, and
frankly states the impending doom of
Polyxena to be slaughtered on Achilles'
tomb, and so to be that hero's spirit
bride. At this the girl shows signs of
joy, and eagerly submits herself to
Helen's hands to be decked for the
sacrificial rite.</p>

<p>Hecuba cries out at this, and
laments her almost utter childlessness;
but Andromache envies the doomed
girl her fate.</p>

<p>Helen then informs the women that
the lots have been drawn and their
future lords determined; Andromache
is to be given to Pyrrhus, Cassandra
to Agamemnon, Hecuba to Ulysses.</p>

<p>Pyrrhus now appears to conduct
Polyxena to her death, and is bitterly
scorned and cursed by Hecuba.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
sadly recalls the sacred rites in Troy
and within the forests of Mount Ida,
and grieves that these shall be no more.
They lament the untimely death of
their warrior husbands, whose bodies
have not received proper burial rites,
and whose souls are wandering in the
spirit-world, while they, the hapless
wives, must wander over sea to foreign
homes. They pray that storms may
come and overwhelm the ships, and
especially that Helen may not live to
reach the land again.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus
enlarges upon the comfort of company
to those in grief. Hitherto they have
had this comfort; but now they are to
be scattered, and each must suffer
alone. And soon, as they sail away,
they must take their last, sad view of
Troy, now but a smouldering heap;
and mother to child will say, as she
points back to the shore:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
the dead body of Astyanax borne upon
the shield of Hector. He explains
that Pyrrhus has hastened home,
summoned by news of insurrection in
his own kingdom, and has taken Andromache
with him. He delivers Andromache's
request to Hecuba that she
give the boy proper burial, and use the
hollow shield as a casket for the dead.</p>

<p>Hecuba and the chorus together
weep over the shield, which recalls
Hector in his days of might, and over
the poor, bruised body of the dead boy,
sadly contrasting his former beauty
with this mangled form. They then
wrap it in such costly wrappings as
their state allows, place him upon the
shield, and consign him to the tomb.</p>

<p>Talthybius then orders bands of men
with torches to burn the remaining
buildings of Troy; and in the light of
its glaring flames and with the crashing
sound of its falling walls in their ears,
Hecuba and her companions make
their way to the waiting ships, while
the messenger urges on their lagging
steps.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;The messenger relates with
much detail to Hecuba, Andromache
and the rest, the circumstances of the
death of Astyanax and Polyxena:
how crowds of Greeks and Trojans
witnessed both tragedies, how both
sides were moved to tears at the sad
sight, and how both victims met their
death as became their noble birth.</p>

<p>Andromache bewails and denounces
the cruel death of her son, and sadly
asks that his body be given her for
burial; but she is told that this is
mangled past recognition.</p>

<p>But Hecuba, having now drained
her cup of sorrow to the dregs, has no
more wild cries to utter; she almost
calmly bids the Grecians now set sail,
since nothing bars their way. She
longs for death, complaining that it
ever flees from her, though she has
often been so near its grasp.</p>

<p>The messenger interrupts, and bids
them hasten to the shore and board
the ships, which wait only their coming
to set sail.</p></div>

the tedium of his long and solitary
task; and prays for the time to come
when, through the darkness of the
night, he shall see the distant flashing
of the beacon fire, and by this sign
know that Troy has fallen and that
Agamemnon is returning home. And
suddenly he sees the gleam for which
so long he has been waiting. He springs
up with shouts of joy and hastens
to tell the queen. At the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
he makes dark reference to that which
has been going on within the palace,
and which must now be hushed up.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Prologue.</i>&mdash;The ghost of Thyestes
coming from the lower regions recites
the <i>motif</i> of the play: how he had been
most foully dealt with by Agamemnon's
father, Atreus, and how he had
been promised revenge by the oracle
of Apollo through his son Aegisthus,
begotten of an incestuous union with
his daughter. The ghost announces
that the time for his revenge is come
with the return of Agamemnon from

voice one of the motives which
led to the king's own death.</p></div>

asks the meaning of this. Has she
had news from Troy? The queen
replies that this very night she has had
news, and describes at length how the
signal fires had gleamed, and thus the
news had leaped from height to height,
all the long way from Troy to Argos.</p>

as soon as he comes back to his home.
She is further impelled to this action
by his conduct in the matter of her

unfaithfulness to her during his long

of its sires," and brings destruction to
the house that sheltered it.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Second choral interlude.</i>&mdash;A chorus
of captive Trojan women sings the
fate and fall of Troy; while Cassandra,
seized with fits of prophetic fury,
prophesies the doom that hangs over
Agamemnon.</p></div>

<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original">
<p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Agamemnon is seen
approaching in his chariot, followed
by his train of soldiers and captives.
The chorus welcomes him, but with a
veiled hint that all is not well in Argos.
Agamemnon fittingly thanks the gods
for his success and for his safe return,
and promises in due time to investigate
affairs at home.</p>

<p>Clytemnestra, now entering, in a
long speech of fulsome welcome,
describes the grief which she has
endured for her lord's long absence in
the midst of perils, and protests her
own absolute faithfulness to him.
She explains the absence of Orestes
by saying that she has intrusted him to
Strophius, king of Phocis, to be cared
for in the midst of the troublous times.
She concludes with the ambiguous
prayer:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i2">Ah Zeus, work out for me</div>
<div class="i0">All that I pray for; let it be thy care</div>
<div class="i0">To look to that thou purposest to work.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Agamemnon, after briefly referring
to Cassandra and bespeaking kindly
treatment for her, goes into the palace,
accompanied by Clytemnestra.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third episode.</i>&mdash;Agamemnon comes
upon the scene, and, meeting Cassandra,
is warned by her of the fate
that hangs over him; but she is not
believed.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="original"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;The chorus,
though it sees with its own eyes
that all is well with Agamemnon, that
he is returned in safety to his own
home, is filled with sad forebodings of
some hovering evil which it cannot
dispel.</p></div>

<div class="comparison"><p><i>Third choral interlude.</i>&mdash;Apropos of
the fall of Troy, the chorus of Argive
women sings the praises of Hercules
whose arrows had been required by
fate for the destruction of Troy.</p></div>
<div class="sync">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="original">
<p><i>Exode.</i>&mdash;Clytemnestra returns and
bids Cassandra, who still remains
standing in her chariot, to join the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
other slaves in ministering at the altar.
But Cassandra stands motionless,
paying no heed to the words of the
queen, who leaves the scene saying:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">I will not bear the shame of uttering more.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Cassandra now descends from her
chariot and bursts into wild and woeful
lamentations. By her peculiar clairvoyant
power she foresees and declares
to the chorus the death of Agamemnon
at the hands of Clytemnestra and
Aegisthus, as well as the manner of it;
she also foretells the vengeance which
Orestes is destined to work upon the
murderers. Her own fate is as clearly
seen and announced, as she passes
through the door into the palace.</p>

<p>Soon the chorus hears the death cry
of Agamemnon, that he is "struck
down with deadly stroke." They are
faint-heartedly and with a multiplicity
of counsel discussing what it is best to
do when Clytemnestra, with blood-stained
garments and followed by a
guard of soldiers, enters to them from
the palace. The corpses of Agamemnon
and Cassandra are seen through
the door within the palace. The
queen confesses, describes, and exults
in the murder of her husband. The
chorus makes elaborate lamentation
for Agamemnon, and prophesies that
vengeance will light on Clytemnestra.
But she scorns their threatening
prophecies. In the end Aegisthus
enters, avowing that he has plotted
this murder and has at last avenged
his father, Thyestes, upon the father
of Agamemnon, Atreus, who had so
foully wronged Thyestes. The chorus
curses him and reminds him that
Orestes still lives and will surely
avenge his father.</p></div>

<div class="comparison">
<p>
<i>Exode.</i>&mdash;Cassandra, either standing
where she can see within the palace,
or else by clairvoyant power, reports
the murder of Agamemnon, which is
being done within.</p>

<p>Electra urges Orestes to flee before
his mother and Aegisthus shall
murder him also. Very opportunely,
Strophius comes in his chariot, just
returning as victor from the Olympic
games. Electra intrusts her brother
to his care, and betakes her own self
to the altar for protection.</p>

<p>Electra, after defying and denouncing
her mother and Aegisthus, is
dragged away to prison and torture,
and Cassandra is led out to her death.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
